The '''Golden Globe Awards'''  are accolades bestowed by the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] beginning in January 1944,&lt;ref name = hfpahistory&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.goldenglobes.com/history-golden-globes|title= History of the Golden Globes|access-date= August 16, 2018|work= Golden Globe Awards|publisher= Hollywood Foreign Press Association|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180720235613/https://www.goldenglobes.com/history-golden-globes|archive-date= July 20, 2018|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing excellence in both American and international film and television.  Beginning in 2022, there are 105 members of the HFPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-10-01|title=Meet the New, Revamped Hollywood Foreign Press Association, 105 Members Strong|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2021/10/new-hollywood-foreign-press-association-105-1234668670/|access-date=2022-02-09|website=[[IndieWire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The annual ceremony at which the awards are presented is normally held every January, and is a major part of the film industry's awards season, which culminates each year in the [[Academy Awards]]. The eligibility period for the Golden Globes corresponds to the calendar year (from January 1 through December 31).

==History==
The [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] (HFPA) was founded in 1943 by [[Los Angeles]]-based foreign [[journalist]]s seeking to develop a better organized process of gathering and distributing cinema news to non-U.S. markets.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Hollywood Foreign Press Association?|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/10/10741076/golden-globes-2016-hfpa-explained|publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/throughtheireyes00step|url-access=registration|title=Through Their Eyes: Foreign Correspondents in the United States|first=Stephen|last=Hess|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=[[Brookings Institution Press]]|access-date=October 31, 2016|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_201004//ai_n53123920/|title=FindArticles.com – CBSi|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the organization's first major endeavors was to establish a ceremony similar to the [[Academy Awards]] to honor film achievements. The [[1st Golden Globe Awards]], honoring the best achievements in [[1943 in film|1943 filmmaking]], were held in January 1944, at the [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including [[the Beverly Hills Hotel]] and the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].

In 1950, the HFPA established a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. The official name of the award thus became the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]].&lt;ref name="Cecil B. deMille Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/cecil-b-demille-award-0|title=The Cecil B. deMille Award|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200119110215/https://www.goldenglobes.com/cecil-b-demille-award-0|archive-date=January 19, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[13th Golden Globe Awards]] held in February 1956 saw the first Golden Globe in Television Achievement. The first three permanent television award categories, [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama|Best TV Series]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama|Best TV Actor]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama|Best TV Actress]], then made their debuts during the [[19th Golden Globe Awards]] held in March 1962.

Beginning in 1963, the trophies commenced to be handed out by one or more persons referred to as "Miss Golden Globe", a title renamed on January 5, 2018, to "[[Golden Globe Ambassador]]". The holders of the position were, traditionally, the daughters or sometimes the sons of a celebrity, and as a point of pride, these often continued to be contested among celebrity parents.&lt;ref name="New York Times 5 January 2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harel|first1=Monica Corcoran|title=Miss Golden Globe Is No More.

In 2009, the Golden Globe statuette was redesigned (but not for the first time in its history). The New York firm [[Society Awards]] collaborated for a year with the HFPA to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette's quality and gold content. It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show.&lt;ref name="Golden Globe Statuette"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-503683_162-4707856.html|title=New Look For Golden Globe Statuette|access-date=December 27, 2012|work=cbsnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026110826/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-503683_162-4707856.html|archive-date=October 26, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carol Burnett Award]] was created as a television counterpart to the Cecil B. DeMille Award, named after its first recipient in 2019, actress and comedian [[Carol Burnett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/carol-burnett-award-0|title=The Carol Burnett Award|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524151528/https://www.goldenglobes.com/carol-burnett-award-0|archive-date=May 24, 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the HFPA to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals. The most prominent beneficiary is the [[Young Artist Award]]s, presented annually by the [[Young Artist Foundation]], established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member [[Maureen Dragone]], to recognize and award excellence of young [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged.&lt;ref name="Golden Globes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfpa.org/|title=HFPA Golden Globes – Young Artist Foundation|access-date=March 31, 2011|work=hfpa.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213091353/http://www.hfpa.org/|archive-date=December 13, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC Local"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&amp;id=7380555|title=KABC-TV – Budding stars shine at Young Artist Awards|access-date=March 31, 2011|work=ABCLocal.go.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023941/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Fentertainment&amp;id=7380555|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young Artist Awards 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/presidents.html|title=Young Artist Awards – President's Message|access-date=March 31, 2011|work=YoungArtistAwards.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116181906/http://www.youngartistawards.org/presidents.html|archive-date=January 16, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
===Eligibility===
The qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31.&lt;ref name="GGRules"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/04/HFPA-Golden-Globe-Awards-Eligibility-Descriptions-Effective-2-1-15.pdf | title=Golden Globe Award Consideration Rules | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | access-date=January 10, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110174939/https://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/04/HFPA-Golden-Globe-Awards-Eligibility-Descriptions-Effective-2-1-15.pdf | archive-date=January 10, 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voice-over performances and cameo appearances in which persons play themselves are not eligible from all of the film and TV acting categories.

Films must be at least 70 minutes and released for at least a seven-day run in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], starting prior to midnight on December 31. Films can be released in theaters, on [[pay-per-view]], or by digital delivery.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

For the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category, films do not need to be released in the United States. At least 51 percent of the dialogue must be in a language other than English, and they must first be released in their country of origin during a 14-month period from November 1 to December 31 prior to the Awards. However, if a film was not released in its country of origin due to censorship, it can still qualify if it had a one-week release in the United States during the qualifying calendar year. There is no limit to the number of submitted films from a given country.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

A TV program must air in the United States between the [[prime time]] hours of 8 p.m. and 11 p.m (or 7 p.m. and 11 p.m on Sundays). A show can air on [[broadcast television]], on basic or premium cable, or by digital delivery; it does not qualify if it is only on pay-per-view or via digital delivery of film. Also, a TV show must either be made in the United States or be a co-production financially and creatively between an American and a foreign production company. Furthermore, [[Reality television|reality]] and non-scripted shows are disqualified.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

A film cannot be entered in both the film and TV categories, and instead should be entered based on its original release format. If it was first aired on American television, then it can be entered into the TV categories. If it was released in theaters or on pay-per-view, then it should instead be entered into the film categories. A film festival showing does not count towards disqualifying what would otherwise be a TV program.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

Actors in a TV series must appear in at least six episodes during the qualifying calendar year. Actors in a TV film or miniseries must appear in at least five percent of the time in that TV film or miniseries.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

===Screening requirements===
Active HFPA members need to be invited to an official screening of each eligible film directly by its respective distributor or publicist. The screening must take place in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], either before the film's release or up to one week afterwards. The screening can be a regular screening in a theater with the public or a press screening; it does not need to be an HFPA member-only event. The screening must also be cleared with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] so there are no scheduling conflicts with other official screenings.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

For TV programs, they must merely be available to be seen by HFPA members in any common format, including the original TV broadcast.

===Nominations and voting===
Entry forms for films need to be received by the HFPA within ten days of the official screening. TV programs should be submitted "as early as possible" before the deadline.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

As part of their regular journalistic jobs, active HFPA members will participate in covering the press conferences, and interviewing cast members, of selected films and TV programs. The film press conferences need to take place either before the film's release in the Greater Los Angeles area or up to one week afterwards.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

Ballots to select the nominations are sent to HFPA members in November, along with a "Reminder List" of eligible film and TV programs.&lt;ref name="GGTime"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/award-rules•entry-forms | title=Award Rules And Entry Forms | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | access-date=January 10, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208205241/https://www.goldenglobes.com/award-rules%E2%80%A2entry-forms | archive-date=December 8, 2017 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each HFPA member then votes for their top five choices in each category, numbering them 5 to 1, with 5 being their top choice. The nominees in each category are then the five selections that receive the most votes. The [[ranked voting]] is only used to break ties, with number 5 worth 5 points, number 4 worth 4 points, and so on.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

After the nominations are announced in mid-December, HFPA members receive the final ballots.&lt;ref name="GGTime" /&gt; The winner in each category is selected from among the nominees by [[plurality voting]]. In case of a tie, the winner is the one that had the most votes on the nomination ballot.&lt;ref name="GGRules" /&gt;

==Ceremony==
{{Main|List of Golden Globe Awards ceremonies}}
The broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards, [[broadcasting|telecast]] to 167 countries worldwide, generally ranks as the third most-watched awards show each year, behind only the [[Academy Award|Oscars]] and the [[Grammy Award]]s. Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones. Until [[Ricky Gervais]] hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] award ceremonies (the other being the [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=84317|title= Ricky Gervais to Return as Golden Globes Host!|access-date= November 16, 2011|date= November 16, 2011|publisher= ComingSoon.net|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115745/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=84317|archive-date= November 17, 2011|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]] hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015. The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===2008 disruption===
Due to threats of writers picketing the event as part of the ongoing [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]], the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] ceremony was cancelled and replaced by an hour-long press conference to announce the winners. While [[NBC]], who normally airs the ceremony, was initially intended to be the exclusive broadcaster of the press conference, the network faced conflicts with the HFPA and Dick Clark Productions over the plan. The HFPA subsequently announced that it would not restrict coverage of the press conference by other broadcasters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Michael|last2=Adalian|first2=Josef|date=2008-01-11|title=Golden Globes telecast up for grabs|url=https://variety.com/2008/tv/news/golden-globes-telecast-up-for-grabs-1117978923/|access-date=2019-03-30|website=Variety|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E!]] (several years before the [[NBCUniversal]] merger) and [[TV Guide Network]] (who were typically known for red carpet coverage from major awards shows) both aired coverage of the press conference, as well as [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=No Red Carpet For TV Guide Net's 'Golden Globes'|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/73976/no-red-carpet-for-tv-guide-nets-golden-globes.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330070627/https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/73976/no-red-carpet-for-tv-guide-nets-golden-globes.html|archive-date=March 30, 2019|access-date=March 30, 2019|website=Mediapost|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=January 8, 2008|title=TV Guide Network downsizes, but doesn't cancel, Golden Globes coverage|url=https://variety.com/2008/biz/awards/tv-guide-network-downsizes-but-doesnt-cancel-golden-globes-coverage-24127/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330093438/https://variety.com/2008/biz/awards/tv-guide-network-downsizes-but-doesnt-cancel-golden-globes-coverage-24127/|archive-date=March 30, 2019|access-date=March 30, 2019|website=Variety|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC declined to air the conference itself; the ceremony timeslot was filled by a ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' preview special, an hour-long results special hosted by ''[[Access Hollywood]]''{{'}}s [[Billy Bush]] and [[Nancy O'Dell]], and an ''Access Hollywood'' post-show also hosted by Bush and O'Dell.&lt;ref name="CTribune"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan, Maureen|date=January 13, 2008|title=Golden Globes winners?

=== Broadcasting ===
The HFPA has had a lucrative contract with [[NBC]] for decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Reed|date=January 16, 2011|title=The Moet the merrier|url=https://nypost.com/2011/01/16/the-moet-the-merrier/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/2018.08.16-190815/https://nypost.com/2011/01/16/the-moet-the-merrier/|archive-date=August 16, 2018|work=The NY Post|quote=And the HFPA has no problem paying for it; a lucrative contract with NBC makes the organization rich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began broadcasting the award ceremony locally in Los Angeles in 1958, then nationally in 1964. However, in 1968, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] claimed the show "misled the public as to how the winners were determined" (allegations included that winners were determined by lobby; to motivate winners to show up to the awards ceremony winners were informed if they did not attend another winner would be named). The FCC admonished NBC for participating in the scandal.

NBC subsequently pulled the awards ceremony from its broadcast until 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, [[Dick Clark Productions]] (DCP) has produced the ceremony with NBC as a broadcaster; DCP's involvement came at a time of instability for the Golden Globes, including reduced credibility and having lost its contract with [[CBS]] (the interim period saw it contract with cable network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] to air the ceremony).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinraub |first1=Bernard |title=Track Record Polishes Golden Globes' Gleam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/20/movies/track-record-polishes-golden-globes-gleam.html |access-date=22 June 2022 |agency=New York Times |date=Jan 20, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiastic over Clark's commitment, the HFPA's contract contained an unusual provision granting Dick Clark Productions the role of producer in perpetuity, as long as it continued to maintain broadcast rights with NBC.&lt;ref name="thr-dcpsuit"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dick Clark Productions Prevails in Golden Globes Trial, Will Remain Show Producer|language=en|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dick-clark-productions-prevails-golden-318099|url-status=live|access-date=December 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202102810/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dick-clark-productions-prevails-golden-318099|archive-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Dick Clark Productions reached an extension with NBC through 2018. However, the deal was negotiated without the HFPA's knowledge. The HFPA sued DCP over the deal, as well as claims that the company was attempting to sell digital rights that it did not hold; the HFPA had wanted a new contract that would grant them a larger share of revenue from the telecast.&lt;ref name="thr-dcpsuit" /&gt;

In April 2012, judge [[Howard Matz]] upheld the NBC perpetuity clause and ruled in favor of DCP, noting that the HFPA had a history of "unbusinesslike display[s] of misplaced priorities" and "[succumbing] to bouts of pronounced turmoil and personal feuds", in contrast to DCP, which had been "represented by one experienced executive who was adept at dealing fairly and effectively with the often amateurish conduct of HFPA." Matz pointed out examples of the HFPA's enthusiasm over the relationship and their desire to "not get cancelled", such as having disregarded its own bylaws by approving an extension in 2001 without a formal vote. The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name="thr-dcpsuit" /&gt;

In 2014, Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA reached a settlement; details were not released, but DCP committed to continue its role as producer through at least the end of its current contract with NBC, and to work with the HFPA to "expand the brand with unique and exciting entertainment experiences". NBC held a right of first refusal to renew its contract beyond 2018, but bidding was to be open to other broadcasters;&lt;ref name="variety-settlehfpa"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ted|date=July 14, 2014|title=HFPA Settles Golden Globes Lawsuit With Dick Clark Prods.|language=en-US|work=Variety|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/hfpa-settles-golden-globes-lawsuit-with-dick-clark-prods-1201262046/|url-status=live|access-date=December 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114001218/http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/hfpa-settles-golden-globes-lawsuit-with-dick-clark-prods-1201262046/|archive-date=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Golden Globes Players Settle Long-Running Legal War (Exclusive)|language=en|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/golden-globes-players-settle-long-716353|url-status=live|access-date=December 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203224425/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/golden-globes-players-settle-long-716353|archive-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2018, NBC agreed to renew its rights to the Golden Globes through 2027, maintaining the current broadcast arrangement and the involvement of Dick Clark Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NBC and HFPA Sign 8-Year Deal for Golden Globes|language=en|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-hfpa-sign-8-year-deal-golden-globes-1143478|url-status=live|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918123533/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-hfpa-sign-8-year-deal-golden-globes-1143478|archive-date=September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|date=September 14, 2018|title=NBC Sets Eight-Year Golden Globes Deal|language=en-US|work=Variety|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/nbc-closes-golden-globes-deal-1202942412/|url-status=live|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918123626/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/nbc-closes-golden-globes-deal-1202942412/|archive-date=September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 and 2020, NBC televised the late Sunday afternoon [[National Football League]] (NFL) playoff game (which had historically gone to another NFL broadcaster) as a lead-in to the Golden Globes.

==Criticism==
===Henry Gris resignation===
Former HFPA president Henry Gris resigned from the board in 1958 claiming that "certain awards are being given more or less as  favors" with others querying why so many winners were represented by one public relations firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 5, 1958|page=26|title='Fix-Via-PR' Rumors Mar Foreign Prizes|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety210-1958-03#page/n23/mode/1up|access-date=January 18, 2021|via=[[Archive.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pia Zadora awarded "New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture" in 1982===
In [[39th Golden Globe Awards|1982]], [[Pia Zadora]] won a Golden Globe in the category "[[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress|New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture]]" for her performance in ''[[Butterfly (1982 film)|Butterfly]]'', over such competition as [[Elizabeth McGovern]] (''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'') and [[Kathleen Turner]] (''[[Body Heat]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Golden_Globes_USA/1982 Golden Globes, USA (1982)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129012524/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Golden_Globes_USA/1982 |date=January 29, 2009 }} IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations were made that the Foreign Press Association members had been bought off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stomptokyo.com/pia/articles/genesis.html |title=Pia Zadora |publisher=Stomptokyo.com |access-date=November 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202075510/http://stomptokyo.com/pia/articles/genesis.html |archive-date=February 2, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zadora's husband, multimillionaire [[Meshulam Riklis]], flew voting members to his casino, the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], which gave the appearance that they voted for Zadora to repay this. Riklis also invited voting members to his house for a lavish lunch and a showing of the film. He also spent a great deal on advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adelson |first=Suzanne |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081499,00.html |title=How Did Actress Pia Zadora Ever Win a Golden Globe?

===''The Tourist'' for Best Musical/Comedy nominations in 2011===
The nominations for the [[68th Golden Globe Awards|2011 Golden Globes]] drew initial skepticism, as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' in its Best Musical/Comedy categories, even though it was originally advertised as a spy thriller, along with being one of the most panned films of the season.  Host [[Ricky Gervais]] even jokingly asked the main star of the film, [[Johnny Depp]], if he had seen it. Rumors then surfaced that Sony, the distributor of ''The Tourist'', had influenced Globes voters with an all-expenses-paid trip to [[Las Vegas]], culminating in a concert by [[Cher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Guy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bribed-golden-globe-judges-nominate-flops-after-vegas-junket-2164322.html |title=Bribed Golden Globe judges nominate flops after Vegas junket: 'The Tourist' and 'Burlesque' are among poorly reviewed films up for awards |newspaper=The Independent |date=December 19, 2010 |access-date=December 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222011134/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bribed-golden-globe-judges-nominate-flops-after-vegas-junket-2164322.html |archive-date=December 22, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian films excluded from Best Motion Picture categories===
In 2020, the HFPA received widespread criticism for nominating Asian and Asian American films, such as ''[[The Farewell (2019 film)|The Farewell]]'', ''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'' and ''[[Minari (film)|Minari]]'', for Best Foreign Language Film while excluding them from the Best Motion Picture categories.  The decision to categorize ''Minari'' as a foreign language film, despite having an exclusively American production team and setting, was heavily condemned by many actors and filmmakers of Asian descent.&lt;ref name=varietyarticle&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/minari-foreign-language-film-golden-globes-1234874332/|title=Hollywood Slams Golden Globes for Categorizing 'Minari' as Foreign Language Film: 'Enough of This Nonsense'|first1=Janet W.|last1=Lee|website=[[Indiewire]]|date=December 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/12/golden-globes-backlash-minari-best-picture-shut-out-racist-1234606324/|title=Golden Globes Under Fire for Shutting 'Minari' Out of Best Picture: 'Racist,' 'Complete Bullsh*t'|first1=Zack|last1=Sharf|website=Indiewire|date=December 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While HFPA rules stipulate that a film must have at least 50% English dialogue to be nominated for the Best Drama or Comedy/Musical categories, critics noted that the films ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' and ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' did not meet the 50% threshold but were still nominated for the Best Motion Picture categories, prompting accusations of anti-Asian racism.&lt;ref name=varietyarticle /&gt;

{{as of|2014}}, there were 26 categories of awards, in addition to several special awards. Starting with 11 awards in 1947, the names and number of categories have changed over the years. Some examples: the category Best Book of a Musical was originally called "Best Author (Musical)." The category of Best Costume Design was one of the original awards. For two years, in 1960 and 1961, this category was split into Best Costume Designer (Dramatic) and Best Costume Designer (Musical). It then went to a single category, but in 2005 it was divided again. For the category of Best Director of a Play, a single category was for directors of plays and musicals prior to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Pesner, Ben.

==History==
{{main|List of Tony Awards ceremonies}}
The award was founded in 1947 by a committee of the [[American Theatre Wing]] (ATW) headed by Brock Pemberton. The award is named after Antoinette Perry, nicknamed Tony, an actress, director, producer and co-founder of the American Theatre Wing, who died in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.playbill.com/news/article/151710-FROM-THE-2011-TONY-PLAYBILL-Who-Was-the-Original-Tony | first = Ellis | last = Nassour | title = From The 2011 Tony Playbill: Who Was the Original 'Tony'? | work = [[Playbill]] | date = June 10, 2011 | access-date = July 4, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130506203106/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/151710-FROM-THE-2011-TONY-PLAYBILL-Who-Was-the-Original-Tony | archive-date = May 6, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As her official biography at the Tony Awards website states, "At &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Warner Bros.]] story editor] Jacob Wilk's suggestion, [Pemberton] proposed an award in her honor for distinguished stage acting and technical achievement.

Since 1967, the award ceremony has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes songs from the nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and [[The Broadway League]] jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS's senior vice president in charge of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. 'It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive to upscale premium advertisers,' Mr. Sussman said..."&lt;ref&gt;Jesse McKinley (June 1, 2003).

=== Medallion ===
The Tony Award medallion was designed by [[art director]] [[Herman Rosse]] and is a mix of mostly [[brass]] and a little [[bronze]], with a [[Electroless nickel plating|nickel plating]] on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the nickel-plated pewter swivel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.playbill.com/features/article/118031.html | last = Pincus-Roth | first = Zachary | title = Ask Playbill.com: Tony Statuettes | work = [[Playbill]] | date = May 22, 2008 | access-date = September 13, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208071125/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/118031.html | archive-date = December 8, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks.  Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner's name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/faq/index.html#20 | title = Tony Awards FAQ | publisher = tonyawards.com | access-date = September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://americantheatrewing.org/tony/history_of_the_tony_awards.php | title = A History of the Tony Awards | publisher = [[American Theatre Wing]] | access-date = September 13, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130716221216/http://americantheatrewing.org/tony/history_of_the_tony_awards.php | archive-date = July 16, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A larger base was introduced in time for the 2010 award ceremony. The new base is slightly taller{{spaced ndash}} {{convert|5|in|cm}}, up from {{convert|3+1/4|in|cm}}{{spaced ndash}} and heavier{{spaced ndash}} {{convert|3+1/2|lb|kg}}, up from {{convert|1+1/2|lb|g|abbr=off}}. This change was implemented to make the award "feel more substantial" and easier to handle at the moment the award is presented to the winners. According to Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theatre Wing:

{{blockquote|We know the physical scale of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]. While we're not attempting to [[keep up with the Joneses]], we felt this is a significant award, and it could feel and look a bit more significant... By adding height, now someone can grip the Tony, raise it over their head in triumph and not worry about keeping their grip. Believe me, you can tell the difference.&lt;ref&gt;Piepenburg, Erik.

For the specific Tony Awards presented to a Broadway production, awards are given to the author and up to two of the producers free of charge. All other members of the above-the-title producing team are eligible to purchase the physical award. Sums collected are designed to help defray the cost of the Tony Awards ceremony itself. An award cost $400 as of at least 2000, $750 as of at least 2009, and, as of 2013, had been $2,500 "for several years", according to Tony Award Productions.&lt;ref name=nytpurchase&gt;{{cite news |  title = Broadway Success Has a Price: $2,500 | url = http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/theater/theaterspecial/broadway-success-has-a-price-2500.html | first = Patrick | last= Healy | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 4, 2013 | access-date = July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules for a new play or musical===
For the purposes of the award, a new play or musical is one that has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not "determined… to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire", as determined by the Administration Committee (per Section (2g) of the Rules and Regulations).&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; The rule about "classic" productions was instituted by the Tony Award Administration Committee in 2002, and stated (in summary) "A play or musical that is determined ... to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire shall not be eligible for an award in the Best Play or Best Musical Category but may be eligible in that appropriate Best Revival category."&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew; Simonson, Robert (September 19, 2002).

''[[Playbill]]''.  Retrieved September 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Shows transferred from [[Off-Broadway]] or the [[West End theatre|West End]] are eligible as "new", as are productions based closely on films.

This rule has been the subject of some controversy, as some shows, such as ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' and ''[[Violet (musical)|Violet]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/04/tonys-hedwig-violet-ineligible-best-musical-category-720036/|title=Tony Bosses Declare Broadway Debutantes 'Violet' &amp; 'Hedwig' Ineligible For Best Musical Category|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|date=April 25, 2014 |website=Deadline |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been ruled ineligible for the "new" category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the important awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, some people{{Who|date=April 2011}} feel that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as "new" gives them an unfair advantage because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters.

===Committees and voters===
The Tony Awards Administration Committee has twenty-four members: ten designated by the American Theatre Wing, ten by The Broadway League, and one each by the Dramatists Guild, Actors' Equity Association, United Scenic Artists and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. This committee, among other duties, determines eligibility for nominations in all awards categories.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

===Broadway theatre===
A Broadway theatre is defined as having 500 or more seats, among other requirements. While the rules define a Broadway theatre in terms of its size, not its geographical location, the list of Broadway theatres is determined solely by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. As of the 2016–2017 season, the list consisted solely of 41 theaters: 40 located in the vicinity of [[Times Square]] in New York City and [[Lincoln Center]]'s [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;Pincus-Roth, Zachary (February 7, 2008).

Some advocates of [[gender equality]] and [[non-binary]] people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the Tony Awards, Academy Awards, and Emmy Awards. Though some commentators worry that [[gender discrimination]] would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories, other categories are unsegregated. The [[Grammy Awards]] went gender-neutral in 2012, while the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]] introduced a single [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series|Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series]] category in 2019 to replace their two gender-specific younger actor and actress categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/07/14/1015863360/nonbinary-gender-neutral-emmy-awards-oscars-tonys-mj-rodriguez-asia-kate-dillon |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |title=Best Actor Or Actress?

The '''Borg-Warner Trophy''' is the [[trophy]] presented to the winner of the [[Indianapolis 500]]. It is named for and was commissioned by automotive supplier [[BorgWarner]]. It is permanently housed at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum]] in [[Speedway, Indiana]]. Unveiled at a 1936 dinner hosted by then-Speedway owner [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], the trophy was officially declared the annual prize for Indianapolis 500 victors. It was first presented at the [[1936 Indianapolis 500|24th annual 500-mile race]], where [[Louis Meyer]], that year's champion and its first recipient, soon thereafter remarked, "Winning the Borg-Warner Trophy is like winning an [[Olympic medals|Olympic medal]]."

[[Marcus Ericsson]] won the [[2022 Indianapolis 500]], and is the current reigning champion.  Each year, the winning driver is presented with a miniature replica ("Baby Borg") during a reception, which for the 2019 race was presented in early September, about three months after the race. Prior to the trophy's inception, the [[Strauss Trophy]] (first awarded in 1919) was once presented to the winner. The [[Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race|Wheeler-Schebler Trophy]] was awarded to the leader at the 400-mile mark, but was retired when car owner [[Harry Hartz]] claimed it three times.

==History==
The trophy, which has been presented in the winner's circle after every race since 1936, is a very large, multi-tiered item which bears the [[Relief#High_relief|high relief]] sculpture of the likeness of each driver to have won the race since its inception in 1911. Inscribed are the winner's name, year of victory, and average speed. This information is alternated with the faces in a [[checkerboard]] pattern. Included on the base is the gold likeness of [[Tony Hulman]], owner of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] from 1945 to 1977. On the top of the trophy is an unclothed man waving a [[Racing flag#The checkered flag|checkered flag]]. Because this man is depicted naked, after the tradition of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] athletes, the trophy is most often photographed so that the man's arm is swooping down in front of him.

In 1935, the Borg-Warner Automotive Company commissioned designer [[Robert J. Hill]] and [[Gorham, Inc.]], of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to create the trophy at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]10,000. The trophy underwent a refurbishment in 1991 and again in 2004. Today it is insured in excess of $1.3 million.

==Design==
Made of [[sterling silver]], the trophy is just under {{convert|5|ft|4|in|cm}} tall and weighs nearly {{convert|153|lb|kg}}. The trophy body itself is hollow, and the [[dome]]-shaped top is removable. From 1936 to 1985, the trophy appeared in its original form, with the bottom rim of the body serving as its stand. The original body had room for 70 winners of the Indy 500, and was destined to fill up after the [[1986 Indianapolis 500|1986 winner]] was affixed. During the early years, the trophy was [[Polishing (metalworking)|polished]] often for protection, but appeared too seldom be buffed to a glossy "mirror finish" and often was seen with a dull or [[wikt:matte#Adjective|matte]] finish. At no point has the trophy been allowed to fall in a state of [[tarnish]] or major disrepair. When the race was suspended during [[World War II]], the trophy was stored in a secure location.

A base was added in 1986 to accommodate more winners, similar to what has been done with the [[Stanley Cup]]. In 1991, the trophy went through a thorough restoration. In 2004, the first base was removed, and replaced with a new, larger base to accommodate more winners. Enough space is currently available to hold all winners through 2033.

Since 1990 the winning drivers' likenesses on both the Borg-Warner Trophy and the replica trophies have been sculpted by prominent American sculptor [[William Behrends]], who also created the statue of baseball great [[Willie Mays]] that stands at the entrance to [[Oracle Park]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='All Choked Up / Giants Legend Willie Mays Is Moved By Statue of Him for New Ballpark'|first=Edward|last=Epstein|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-08-07/news/17729836_1_statue-china-basin-new-stadium|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=August 7, 1998|access-date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baby Borg==

The actual perpetual trophy is not given to the winner; it remains at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]. The winning drivers since 1988 have been presented with an {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} tall free-standing replica of the trophy, sitting on a [[bevel]]ed square base. Officially titled the "Indianapolis 500 Champion Driver's Trophy,", it has been affectionately nicknamed the "Baby Borg." The Baby Borg is typically presented the following January at a Speedway reception or sometimes at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit, near trophy sponsor BorgWarner's headquarters. 

Starting with the 1997 race, a second Baby Borg was added, presented to the winning car owner(s), officially named the "Indianapolis 500 Champion Owner's Trophy". The owner's trophy is nearly identical to the driver's trophy, except it is mounted upon a round base. Multiple owner's trophies are presented if there are co-owners to the winning team.

The bas-relief likenesses from the main trophy are not replicated on the Baby Borgs, nor is the cylindrical base of the main trophy (the first of which was added in 1986). In some years, a duplicate of the sculpted likeness of the winner has been affixed to the beveled base of the driver's Baby Borg trophy. The driver's trophy can be lifted from its base if desired.  

Prior to 1988, winners received an {{convert|24|in|mm|adj=on}} upright model of the trophy mounted on a walnut plaque. Since then, some pre-1988 winners have been presented with the newer Baby Borg version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/2016/01/29/trip-down-victory-lane-champion-cave-tells-bobby-rahal-story/79392988/|title=Trip Down Victory Lane: 'Champion cave' tells Bobby Rahal story|publisher=IndyStar.com|first=Curt|last=Cavin|date=January 29, 2016|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/racing/blog/_/name/oreovicz_john/id/8854618/indycar-dario-franchitti-helps-get-parnelli-jones-baby-borg|title=Oreo's world: Jones gets a 'Baby' gift|publisher=ESPN|first=John|last=Oreovicz|date=January 17, 2013|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, race winner [[Dan Wheldon]] was [[2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship|fatally injured]] before he received his Baby Borg. His widow Susie accepted the trophy in his honor.  

In 2013, starting with [[Parnelli Jones]] (the [[1963 Indianapolis 500|1963 winner]]), the Speedway began a tradition of presenting living winners the newer Champion Drivers Trophy on the 50th anniversary of their wins had they not been awarded a Baby Borg. Jones, [[Mario Andretti]] (2019), and [[Al Unser|Al Unser Sr.]] (2020) have each been awarded with such on the 50th anniversaries of their wins.  Since then, the procedure has been conducted on different drivers who had not been awarded a Baby Borg, regardless of years since their win.  In 2021, [[Gordon Johncock]] was awarded Baby Borgs to represent his 1973 and 1982 wins at his Johncock Forestry Products business in [[South Branch, Michigan]] during a birthday party organised by BorgWarner.  In 2022, [[A. J. Foyt]], who has an owner's Baby Borg from 1999, was awarded a driver's Baby Borg, without the sculpted likeness, but with each side carrying one of his four wins, in 2022.

While the perpetual trophy is not given to the winner, it has, on occasion, traveled to various locations to honor the winner. Most recently in 2017, the trophy traveled to Japan accompanying [[Takuma Sato]] on a victory tour of his home country.&lt;ref name="motorsport20171218"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/sato-hails-amazing-trip-to-japan-with-borg-warner-trophy-989538/|title=Sato hails “amazing” trip to Japan with Borg-Warner Trophy|publisher=Motorsport.com|first=David|last=Malsher|date=December 18, 2017|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odd features have been put on the driver's likeness on the "Baby Borg" since it was introduced in 1988.  In 2013, [[Parnelli Jones]]' trophy featured a cowboy hat on his head (prior to 1970, champions were wearing an open-face helmet on their sculptures;  since the bas-relief bust of the driver was newly created by the current sculptor, it was done without helmet and with the cowboy hat he wore primarily during that season). In 2019, because of fan requests, [[Simon Pagenaud]]'s Baby Borg also featured the likeness of his [[Jack Russell terrier]] Norman. BorgWarner added a donation to the Humane Society of Indiana as part of the event, primarily because the dog had participated in the winner's circle photos.

For the 2019 race, the "Baby Borg" was presented at a [[Team Penske]] breakfast in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]] before the INDYCAR season ended.&lt;REF&gt;https://www.wthr.com/article/indy-500-winner-simon-pagenaud-shares-baby-borg-his-dog-norman&gt;&lt;/REF&gt;

==Lore==
[[File:BorgWarnerTrophy1985.JPG|thumb|upright|The Borg-Warner Trophy in its original form (without a base) on display in [[1985 Indianapolis 500|1985]].]]
The trophy has had quite a history; track historian [[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]] has noted a particular story in which a [[Butler University]] student was given the trophy to watch in the 1930s before race day. The young man hid the trophy under his bed one night and proceeded to have a night out. Upon his return to his [[fraternity and sorority houses|fraternity house]], the man found the trophy missing. He looked and looked and became very worried about the trophy's whereabouts. Upon looking in the frat house's basement, he found the trophy surrounded by men who were drinking beer out of it. All of 115 beers were inside of the trophy. Emptying the beer, he wondered how he would get the smell off of the trophy and decided to take a shower – taking the trophy in with him.

The winner of the [[1950 Indianapolis 500]], [[Johnnie Parsons]], had his name misspelled on the trophy. It was scripted into the silver as "Johnny" Parsons (which incidentally, is how his [[Johnny Parsons|son's]] name was spelled). During the 1991 restoration, it was proposed by the handlers to correct the spelling, though Parsons had already died seven years earlier. The decision was made to leave the misspelling in place, as part of the trophy's historic lore.

Through 1985, the trophy was hoisted by handlers directly behind the driver, typically on the [[roll cage|roll bar]] of the car. The trophy could be easily carried by one individual, and was usually simple to transport. After the trophy was affixed with a base in 1986, the trophy's weight, height, and stability became an issue with displaying it on top of the car. At least two men were required to balance the trophy behind the driver. Since about 2004, when the trophy was expanded with the newer base, it is no longer hoisted behind the driver. Initially, the now-heavier trophy was displayed next to the car. However, the trophy was often mired in the tight, crowded confines of victory lane, and became less visible and even risked damage due to the bustling, celebrating crowd. For 2012, coinciding with the introduction of the DW-12 chassis, a special platform was constructed that fits between or behind the rear wheels and rear wing of the cars. The trophy is now placed upon this platform during the victory lane celebration, giving it once again a prominent and more visible presence during the celebration. 

Two or more safety patrol workers are assigned with guarding and transporting the trophy during the month of May. It is polished often, and polished several times during the month of May. In contrast to the earlier years, the trophy is almost exclusively [[Polishing (metalworking)|polished]] and buffed to an elegant, glossy, "mirror finish." During routine times of the month, it is usually situated upon a large, sturdy, custom-built rolling dolly.

The trophy has appeared in several films, including ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]], and ''[[Turbo (film)|Turbo]]''. During the month of May, the trophy has several prominent locations for display. During time trials, the trophy is typically displayed outdoors on a platform near the start/finish line. During down times, it returns to the museum. It also makes several appearances, including the Public Drivers' Meeting and the [[500 Festival Parade]], as well as prominent socials events and gatherings (such as banquets and balls downtown).

The Borg-Warner Trophy was exclusively featured on the cover of the Indianapolis 500 Official Program in 1981, 1998, and 2002. It also appeared on the cover in lesser prevalence in 1988, 1996, and 2006. It is depicted in the cover art of the [[Atari]] video game ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'', in the [[Midway Games|Midway]] pinball machine ''[[Indianapolis 500 (pinball)|Indianapolis 500]]'', and on the cover art for the [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]] ''[[IndyCar Racing]]'' Indianapolis Motor Speedway Expansion Pack.

==Layout and details==
When the trophy debuted in 1936, it was complete with the likenesses of all winners from 1911 to 1935 (except 1917–1918, as the race was not held those two years due to [[World War I]]). Sculptor John Grawe created the twenty-four likenesses representing the first 23 races, including the two co-winners for the [[1924 Indianapolis 500|1924 race]]. Twenty-two of the likenesses were created featuring the driver wearing his [[helmet]] and [[goggles]]. Two faces, those of [[1912 Indianapolis 500|1912]] winner [[Joe Dawson (racing driver)|Joe Dawson]] and [[1921 Indianapolis 500|1921]] winner [[Tommy Milton]], showed the driver without a helmet.

The likeness were placed beginning with [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]] winner [[Ray Harroun]] situated in the middle of the front side. Subsequent faces were added encircling the trophy to the right. The next row would begin in the middle of the front, in the same column as Harroun.
[[File:Traditions - June 2022 - Sarah Stierch.webm|thumb|The Borg-Warner Trophy on display at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum]] in 2022.]]
When the winners began to be added annually after 1936, most were depicted wearing a helmet through 1970. [[Floyd Davis]], who co-won the [[1941 Indianapolis 500|1941 race]] with [[Mauri Rose]], was depicted without a helmet, while Rose was depicted with one. By 1946, most were shown without their goggles. The likeness of [[1957 Indianapolis 500|1957 winner]] [[Sam Hanks]] was the final one to feature goggles. The likeness of [[1970 Indianapolis 500|1970 winner]] [[Al Unser]] is the last to be depicted wearing a helmet (by that time, drivers were wearing full-face helmets, so the feasibility of helmets on drivers was impossible). When he won again the following year, his 1971 likeness was shown with natural hair. It has been standard practice to sculpt a brand new likeness for repeat winners, including drivers who have won in consecutive years.

The likeness of 1986 winner [[Bobby Rahal]] originally featured miniature glasses, as Rahal wore [[glasses]] at the time. The tiny spectacles were crafted from metal wire. In 1993, the trophy was reportedly bumped and the glasses fell off the trophy and were broken.&lt;ref name="Star05-26-1993"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fastest '500' rookie lets speed do talking|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7864061//|first=Curt|last=Cavin|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=41|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 26, 1993|access-date=December 15, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glasses were repaired and later reattached. Rahal failed to qualify for the 1993 race, and some superstitious observers pointed out the incident as a bad omen. The glasses were removed permanently after Rahal started wearing [[Contact lens|contacts]] in the mid-1990s. [[Tom Sneva]], the 1983 winner, insisted his likeness include glasses, and they remain to this day.

Two drivers, both of whom are multiple winners, have their respective names depicted differently in different years. Four-time winner [[Al Unser]] has his name listed as "Al Unser" for his likenesses of [[1970 Indianapolis 500|1970]], [[1971 Indianapolis 500|1971]], and [[1978 Indianapolis 500|1978]]. He is listed as "Al Unser Sr." for his [[1987 Indianapolis 500|1987]] win, owing much to the fact that his son (two-time winner [[Al Unser Jr.]]) was now a driver. Two-time winner [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] is listed as "Juan Montoya" for [[2000 Indianapolis 500|2000]] and as "Juan Pablo Montoya" for [[2015 Indianapolis 500|2015]].

==Base==

===First base===
[[File:Truesports1986parade.jpg|thumb|right|The Borg-Warner Trophy in 1986. The first base that was used from 1986 to 2003 is visible.]]
Following the [[1985 Indianapolis 500]], the likeness of race winner [[Danny Sullivan]] was added to the trophy. His face filled the 69th of the original 70 squares on the trophy body. Only one square remained on the body, which would be filled by the 1986 winner.

In the weeks prior to the [[1986 Indianapolis 500]], in celebration of the trophy's 50th anniversary, a new cylindrical three-row base was added to the bottom of the trophy. It featured room for an additional 18 faces. On the base, the first square was filled with a gold likeness of the late Speedway president [[Tony Hulman]]. The base increased the height of the trophy to {{Convert|55|in||abbr=}}, and the weight to about {{Convert|95|lb||abbr=}}.

The trophy spent the month of May 1986 with one empty square left on the body, and now room for 17 additional winners on the base. The base would have enough room for winners through 2003. Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race, and was the final likeness added to the body of the trophy.

[[Al Unser]] won the [[1987 Indianapolis 500|1987 race]], and became the first race winner to have his likeness added to the first base of the trophy. Unser also became the first winner to have likenesses on the body of the trophy (1970, 1971, 1978) as well as the base (1987). The layout and lettering of the base mimicked that of the trophy body. The driver's name was enscripted in one single line, followed by the year on the next line, and the race average speed below on the third line.

The likeness of 1989 Indianapolis 500 winner [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] was created by 88-year old French sculptor [[Louis Feron]], using the [[Repoussé and chasing|repouseé]] technique. Feron used a single flat sheet of silver and painstakingly hammered it into the shape of Fittipaldi's face.&lt;ref name="News11-28-1989pg2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Emmo's slice is best|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32275393/|first=David|last=Mannweiler|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|page=2|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=November 28, 1989|access-date=June 5, 2019}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a restoration project was conducted on the trophy. As part of the project, a reinforcement rim was added to the base for stability. The refurbishment increased the height of the trophy to {{Convert|60|in||abbr=}}, and the weight to over {{Convert|110|lb||abbr=}}.

The final likeness added to the original base was that of [[Hélio Castroneves]], winner of the [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002 race]].

===Current base===
[[File:President Trump and the Indy 500 Winner (48051777047).jpg|thumb|The Borg-Warner Trophy on its current base and dolly seen with 2019 race winner Simon Pageneud and President Donald Trump]]
Following the 2003 race the original base added in 1986 was removed and replaced with a similar looking one. It consisted of five rows of twelve squares, allowing room for 48 faces. The likenesses of [[Tony Hulman]] and the 1987– 2002 winners were relocated to the new base. The likeness of [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003 winner]] [[Gil de Ferran]] was the first new face to be added to the new base. The new base added at least {{Convert|15|lb||abbr=}} and more than {{Convert|4|in||abbr=}} to the trophy, which now stands at {{Convert|64+1/2|in||abbr=}}, and weighs nearly {{Convert|150|lb||abbr=}}. The current base is expected to accommodate winners through 2033.

One notable difference on the new base is reflected in the descriptions. All listings on the new base script the driver's first name on the first line, surname on the second line, followed by the year on the third line, and average speed on the fourth line. On the old base, and on the trophy body, the drivers' names are written in one single line.

Due to the increased weight and size of the trophy, it was no longer possible to hoist the trophy atop the winning car in victory lane. Handlers would place the trophy on the ground in victory lane, near the rear of the machine, but this often left the trophy obscured from view by the many people surrounding the car. Likewise in the tight confines of victory lane, the trophy was now susceptible to someone bumping into it, risking damage, requiring special care by the handlers. Starting in 2012, with the introduction of the [[Dallara]] DW-12 chassis, a special platform was constructed to display the trophy in a more prominent fashion in victory lane. As soon as the car pulls into victory lane, the customized platform is securely placed behind the rear wing or over one of the rear wheels. The trophy is immediately placed upon the platform, and is displayed in a safer and highly visible location. In addition, during the month when the trophy is displayed trackside, it is typically placed on a decorative dolly for easy transportation.

The '''Mann Cup''' is the trophy awarded to the senior men's [[box lacrosse]] champions of [[Canada]]. The championship is a best-of-seven, East vs West series played between the league champions of [[Major Series Lacrosse]], the East, and [[Western Lacrosse Association]], the West.

The original trophy is now permanently located in the [[Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame]]. It is one of the most valuable in all of sports; made of solid, albeit low-karat, [[gold]], the trophy was valued at CA$60,000 ({{inflation|CA|60000|1980|fmt=eq}}) when appraised by Birks in May 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

It was donated in 1910 by Sir [[Donald Mann]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-824-4908/sports/lacrosse/clip3|title=The Mann Cup: Canada's signature lacrosse event
|work=cbc.ca|access-date=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to then, the [[Minto Cup]] was the senior amateur championship trophy. The Mann Cup was originally a challenge trophy, but in 1925 the champion [[New Westminster Salmonbellies]] turned the trophy over to the [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]] who instituted a national playoff system. The challenges and championships for the Mann Cup were played by the rules of traditional [[field lacrosse]] until 1932, when [[box lacrosse]] was adopted by the Canadian Lacrosse Association. The first indoor Mann Cup was played at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto in October 1932.

There have actually been three Mann Cup trophies in existence - the original and two replicas. The original 1910 trophy was in use from 1910 until 1985, when it was retired permanently to the [[Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame]]. A replica trophy, which has a larger and taller base than the original 1910 trophy, was in use and awarded to teams from 1986 until 2004 when it was destroyed in a bonfire mishap in Peterborough. The second replica replaced the first replica in 2005, and its appearance mirrors the previous 1986 replica trophy and not the original 1910 trophy.

==1914 Calgary Chinooks dispute==
In 1914, the Vancouver Athletic Club defeated the Calgary Chinooks and Brampton Excelsiors in Mann Cup challenge matches but the Mann Cup Trustees disputed the status of one of the Vancouver players in the series versus Brampton.

Despite the views of British Columbia lacrosse, national lacrosse and amateur athletic organisations that supported Vancouver's position, the trustees instead awarded the cup to the Calgary Chinooks on September 29, 1914. Vancouver however held on to the gold trophy and refused to turn it over to either the trustees or the Chinooks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/53365237/the-mann-cup/ "The Mann Cup"] ''Calgary Herald''. Oct. 22, 1914 (pg. 8). Retrieved 2020-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, 1914, the Canadian Amateur Lacrosse Association overruled Mann Cup trustee Joseph Lally and awarded the cup to the Vancouver Athletic Club.

==1922 Vancouver Lacrosse Club==
In 1922, there were two rival leagues located in British Columbia battling for the Mann Cup: Vancouver Lacrosse Club and Victoria Capitals played in the British Columbia Amateur Lacrosse Association's senior league while the New Westminster Salmonbellies and Vancouver Elks played in the Pacific Coast Amateur Lacrosse Association. Control of the Mann Cup was retained by the BCALA after New Westminster left that league to join the PCALA. Vancouver Lacrosse Club won their schedule and were awarded the Mann Cup, while New Westminster won their series in the PCALA.

Just over a month later, Vancouver Lacrosse Club and New Westminster met in a three-game, total goals series to determine who would take home the Mann and Kilmarnock Cups. After Vancouver (who were at the time considered the holders of the Mann Cup) were up 7–6 in goals after two games, they then defaulted their third game after a brawl broke out and the team refused to return to the field. The score was 1-1, so New Westminster lined up and they then went through the formal motions of scoring two unopposed goals into the empty net to take the series and the silverware back by 9 goals to 8.

==1963 Cornwall, Ontario series==
In 1963, [[Cornwall, Ontario]] was named as host city for the Mann Cup despite not even having a senior lacrosse team nor ever participating in the Mann Cup previously.

The Western teams at that time were dominating play in Canada over their Eastern brethren, and had turned down their rights for hosting that year as they wanted the finals held in the East for successive back-to-back years to help stimulate and rejuvenate interest in the sport and the tournament. However none of the then-current teams in the Ontario Lacrosse Association league had, or could raise, the $10,000 required by the host for the performance bond posted with the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

Officials in Cornwall stepped up and in August 1963 the city was awarded the hosting rights for the 1963 Mann Cup. When the CLA had issues getting officials, Stewart Begg age 16, stepped in to officiate

==Cup mishaps==
In 1989, the Mann Cup was stolen from the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in New Westminster, British Columbia. Despite fears of the cup being melted down for its gold content, it turned up a few weeks later, with a small chunk cut out of the rim, but otherwise intact.

Following the 1999 Mann Cup final, the cup broke during the post-game "victory lap" taken by the Victoria Shamrocks around Memorial Arena.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Drew Snider, play-by-play announcer on C-FAX Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Peterborough Lakers won the Mann Cup. During a celebratory gathering the replica of the trophy was dropped in a bonfire and was destroyed.

The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy, officially called the "Academy Award of Merit," although more commonly referred to by its nickname, the "Oscar". The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the [[Art Deco]] style.

==History==
The [[1st Academy Awards|first Academy Awards]] presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at [[The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with an audience of about 270 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1929|title=The 1st Academy Awards {{!}} 1929|website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-date=October 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001234905/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1929|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dunhill Hotel |url=https://www.virtlo.com/countries/united-states-of-america/north-carolina-guide/accommodation-hotels/the-dunhill-hotel-4162852766-n |url-status=live |website=[[Virtlo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |title=History of the Academy Awards |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706040444/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |archive-date=July 6, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (${{Inflation|US|5|1929}} at 2020 prices). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.

For this first ceremony, winners were announced to the media three months earlier. For the second ceremony in 1930, and the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1940, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the following year the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The term "Oscar" is a registered trademark of the AMPAS; however, in the Italian language, it is used [[generic trademark|generically]] to refer to any award or award ceremony, regardless of which field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court: 'Oscar' may be generic term in Italian |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/court-oscar-may-be-generic-132235 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217200730/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/court-oscar-may-be-generic-132235 |archive-date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court: Oscar may be generic term in Italian |work=[[Reuters]] |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/industry-oscar-dc-idUKN1527923720070316 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429045816/http://uk.reuters.com/article/industry-oscar-dc-idUKN1527923720070316 |archive-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of its early history, the Academy Awards did not enjoy the luxury of a permanent home open to the public in California. During the 1930's and the early 1940's, the presentation ceremonies remained private with only occasional live radio coverage from several landmark hotel venues including: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;''Academy Awards Winning Movies 1928-2020: How Movies Have Changed Through the Years''.

By the 1940's, presentations were already being held at historic public theaters including: [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], the [[Shrine Auditorium|Shrine Civic Auditorium]] and the Academy Award Theater. With the advent of widespread television broadcasting in the mid 1950's, the ceremony was opened to an even wider public audience. Consequently, from the 1950's-2001. the presentations were conducted at major entertainment centers including: the [[Pantages Theater (Hollywood)|RKO Pantages Theater]] in Hollywood, the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]], and the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center]]. By 2002, a more permanent venue was created at the [[Kodak Theatre]] (Dolby Theatre) in Hollywood, where the presentation ceremony remained largely undisturbed for nearly two decades until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''Pop Culture Places''.

===Milestones===
The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

At the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category, now known as [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

Perhaps the most widely seen [[streaking|streaker]] in history was 34-year-old [[Robert Opel]], who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host [[David Niven]] quipped, "Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?" Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the [[Ad libitum|ad-lib]] it appeared to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What You Won't See at Oscars On Cue: Behind Those Cameras on Oscar Night |first=Steve |last=Harvey |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 29, 1993 |page=F1 |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16650-story.html |access-date=March 6, 2020 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212307/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16650-story.html |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |title=Disney hoping to win first Oscar for Best Animated Feature |date=February 28, 2014 |work=New York Post |access-date=April 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419053447/https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1973 to 2020, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. For 2021, this tradition was broken as the ceremony ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].

===Naming===
The Academy officially adopted the name "Oscar" for the trophies in 1939. However, the origin of the nickname is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hiskey |first1=Daven |title=Why Are the Academy Awards Statuettes Called Oscars? |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/48892/why-are-academy-awards-statuettes-called-oscars |website=Mental Floss |date=February 22, 2019 |access-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225051435/http://mentalfloss.com/article/48892/why-are-academy-awards-statuettes-called-oscars |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One biography of [[Bette Davis]], who was a president of the Academy in 1941, claims she named the award after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson. A frequently mentioned originator is [[Margaret Herrick]], the Academy executive director, who, when she first saw the award in 1931, said the statuette reminded her of "Uncle Oscar," a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-who-came-up-name-774775|title=Oscars: Who Came Up With the Name "Oscar" and More About the Statuette's History (Video)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 18, 2015|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029231953/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-who-came-up-name-774775|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columnist [[Sidney Skolsky]], who was present during Herrick's naming in 1931, wrote that "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'."&lt;ref name=levy&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |title=All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards |year=2003 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy credits Skolsky with "the first confirmed newspaper reference" to ''Oscar'' in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year's [[6th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 6th Academy Awards Memorable Moments |date=August 27, 2014 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111216/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |archive-date=February 26, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of ''Oscar'': a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html |magazine=Time |title=Cinema: Oscars |date=March 26, 1934 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813182253/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C747239%2C00.html |archive-date=August 13, 2013}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ceremonies that year, [[Walt Disney]] was the first to thank the Academy for his "Oscar" during his acceptance speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://d23.com/oscar-winning-walt/ |title=Oscar-Winning Walt |publisher=d23.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705190129/https://d23.com/oscar-winning-walt/ |archive-date=July 5, 2019|url-status=live |first=Jim|last=Fanning|date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Davis, in preparing a history of the awards for his book ''The Academy and the Award'', found that the term "Oscar" had come from Eleanore Lilleberg, a secretary within the Academy when the award was first introduced, as she had been in charge of pre-ceremony handling of the awards. Davis found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg, Eleanore's brother, that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army veteran named Oscar the two had known in Chicago, who Einar described as "stood straight and tall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://deadline.com/2022/06/once-for-all-bruce-davis-settles-why-they-call-it-oscar-1235052129/ | title = So, Once And For All (We Hope), Bruce Davis Settles Why They Call It 'Oscar' | first =Michael | last = Cieply | date = June 26, 2022 | accessdate = June 26, 2022 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, Brazilian researcher Dr. Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the likely first public mention of the name "Oscar," in journalist Relman Morin's column "Cinematters" in the "Los Angeles Evening Post-Record" on December 5, 1933. As the award did not take place that year, Relman Morin wrote: "What's happened to the annual Academy banquet? As a rule, the banquet and the awarding of "Oscar" the bronze statuette given for best performances, is all over long before this." This information changes the question of Sidney Skolsky as the first to publicly name the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/DalenogareW/status/1401604328222334987/photo/1 | title = First mention of Oscar in print: Relman Morin - December 5, 1933 (Post-Record) | first = Neto | last = Waldemar | date = June 6, 2021 | accessdate = August 3, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline}}

===Engraving===
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oscar statues to include engraved names |first=Greg |last=Kilday |date=February 9, 2010 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412143119/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |archive-date=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Governors Ball Secrets: Welcome to the 'Engraving Station,' Where Oscar Statuettes Get Personalized |url=http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |first=Steve |last=Daly |date=February 28, 2014 |work=Parade Magazine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227170517/http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |archive-date=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===
Prior to 1950, Oscar statuettes were (and remain) the property of the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/02/28/cx_lr_0228oscarsales.html |title=Psst!

If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref name="money.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.com/money/5181378/how-much-oscar-statue-worth/|title=How Much Is an Oscar Statue Worth?

In 1989, [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd's]] grandson tried to sell Todd's [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar for his 1956 production of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' to a movie prop collector. The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.

In 1992, [[Harold Russell]] consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' to auction to raise money for his wife's medical expenses. Though his decision caused controversy, the first-ever Oscar to be sold passed to a private collector on August 6, 1992 for $60,500 (${{Inflation|US|60500|1992|r=-2|fmt=c}} today).

In December 2011, [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 Oscar for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' ([[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar for sale |publisher=CNN |first=Alan |last=Duke |date=December 12, 2011 |access-date=December 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112025602/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |archive-date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542 (${{Inflation|US|861542|2011|r=-2|fmt=c}} today).&lt;ref name="Welles' Oscar sold"&gt;{{cite news |title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar brings $861,000 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |access-date=April 7, 2013 |publisher=CNN |date=December 21, 2011 |first=Alan |last=Duke |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116121806/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |archive-date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination==
From 2004 to 2020, the Academy Award nomination results were announced to the public in mid-January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February. In 2021, the nominees were announced in March. In 2022, the nominees were announced in early February for the first time since 2003.

===Voters===
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of over 7,000 {{as of|lc=y|2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.refinery29.com/2018/02/190829/academy-members-women-oscar-voters |title=How Many Women Are Actually Voting for the Oscar Winners? |access-date=April 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417232906/https://www.refinery29.com/2018/02/190829/academy-members-women-oscar-voters |archive-date=April 17, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) since the [[7th Academy Awards]] in 1935. The firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in January of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |title=How Are Oscar Nominees Chosen? |date=January 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722072631/http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |archive-date=July 22, 2018 |url-status=live |first=Sean|last=Hutchinson|work=Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |title=The men who are counting on Oscar |work=BBC News |first=Jackie |last=Finlay |date=March 3, 2006 |access-date=April 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |archive-date=March 19, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter |title=Meet the only two people in the world who already know all the Oscar winners {{!}} Market Watch |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150240/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter |archive-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html |title=Academy Invites 115 to Become Members |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=September 4, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827031611/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html |archive-date=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horn |first=John |title=Unmasking the Academy |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory |access-date=October 15, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307133844/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html%2C0%2C7473284.htmlstory |archive-date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally |work=The New York Times |first=Michael |last=Cieply |title=Electronic Voting Comes to The Oscars (Finally) |date=May 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105075132/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally/ |archive-date=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], California, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best International Feature Film, Best Documentary Feature, and awards in short film categories). Additionally, the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6&amp;nbsp;pm and 10&amp;nbsp;pm local time.&lt;ref name=92Rule2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |title=Rule Two: Eligibility |work=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=March 20, 2020 |archive-date=January 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114205010/https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |title=Oscars Submission FAQ |access-date=March 16, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401230002/https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |archive-date=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was originally first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]], as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]]. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |title=The Academy and its Oscar Awards – Reminder List of Eligible Releases |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111232741/http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |archive-date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, except for short-subject awards, and it must exist either on a [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021054540/http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archive-date=October 21, 2014 |title=Academy Award Rules |access-date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[90th Academy Awards]], presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of ''[[O.J.: Made in America]]'', an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[ESPN]], in that category in [[89th Academy Awards|2017]]. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |title=Oscars: New Rules Bar Multi-Part Documentaries Like 'O.J.: Made in America' |first=Dave |last=McNary |magazine=Variety |date=April 7, 2017 |access-date=May 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415012418/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |archive-date=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best International Feature Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection.

The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and New York City{{efn|Starting with the [[89th Academy Awards|2017 awards]], a qualifying release for the Documentary Feature award can take place anywhere in New York City. Previously, a New York City qualifying run could only take place in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.oscars.org/news/awards-rules-approved-89th-oscarsr |title=Awards Rules Approved for 89th Oscars® |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=June 30, 2016 |access-date=April 7, 2020 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212337/https://www.oscars.org/news/awards-rules-approved-89th-oscarsr |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} during the previous calendar year, or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list (regardless of any public exhibition or distribution), or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country's official selection. The qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings. Additionally, a film must have been reviewed by a critic from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time Out New York]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', or ''[[LA Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name=92Rule11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |title=Rule Eleven: Special Rules for the Documentary Awards |work=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=March 20, 2020 |archive-date=January 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114205010/https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

Awards in short film categories (Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Animated Short Film, and Best Live Action Short Film) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead of covering one year starting on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in ''either'' Los Angeles County ''or'' New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10&amp;nbsp;pm local time; for other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.&lt;ref name=92Rule11/&gt;&lt;ref name=92Rule19&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |title=Rule Nineteen: Special Rules for the Short Film Awards |work=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=April 7, 2020 |archive-date=January 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114205010/https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In late December, ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. In all major categories, a variant of the [[single transferable vote]] is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially.&lt;ref name="TheEnvelope"&gt;{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017160343/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-oscarvote7jan07%2C0%2C6919642%2Cprint.story?coll=env-home-headlines |archive-date=October 17, 2006 |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-oscarvote7jan07,0,6919642,print.story?coll=env-home-headlines |title=Eight things every voter (and fan) should know about Oscar's decidedly unique nomination process. |first=Steve |last=Pond |access-date=January 27, 2007 |date=January 7, 2006 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/01/27/oscar-voter-ballot-reader-poll-results |title=Oscars: The wacky way the Academy counts votes, and the results of our 'If You Were an Oscar Voter' poll |last=Young |first=John |date=January 27, 2011 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=February 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042043/http://www.ew.com/article/2011/01/27/oscar-voter-ballot-reader-poll-results |archive-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt; In certain categories, including International Feature Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|marketing to awards voters]] for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in [[Oscar season]]. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics |first=Robert |last=Marich |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |edition=3rd |year=2013 |pages=235–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner (''The Hurt Locker'' eventually won).

===Academy Screening Room===
The Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure [[List of streaming media services|streaming platform]] which allows voting members of the Academy to view all eligible films (except, initially, those in the International category) in one place. It was introduced in 2019, for the 2020 Oscars, though DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided. For films to be included on the platform, the North American distributor must pay $12,500, including a [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] fee, and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy. The platform can be accessed via [[Apple TV]] and [[Roku]] players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Anne|date=2019-10-31|title=Academy Opens Online 'Screening Room' for Oscar Contenders|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/oscars-2020-academy-screening-room-feature-voting-1202186244/|access-date=2022-01-25|website=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Urban |first1=Sasha |date=2022-03-17 |title=How the Academy's Screening Room Helps Films Find a Global Audience Among Oscar Voters |url=https://variety.com/2022/film/global/academy-screening-room-oscar-voters-1235204906/ |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watermarking process involved several video security firms, creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: How the Academy Awards Shared Films With Oscar® Voters With Complete Security|url=https://www.brightcove.com/en/customers/academy-motion-picture-arts-and-sciences/|access-date=2022-01-25|website=Brightcove}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, for the 2022 Oscars, the Academy banned all physical screeners and in-person screenings, restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room. Films eligible in the Documentary and International categories were made available in different sections of the platform. Distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform.&lt;ref name=DeadlineScreeningRoom&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammond|first=Pete|date=2021-08-27|title=Oscars: Academy Digital Screening Room Opens With Amazon And Netflix Contenders First To Vie For Voter Attention; DVDs Now Banned|url=https://deadline.com/2021/08/oscars-academy-digital-screening-room-opens-netflix-amazon-1234823367/|access-date=2022-01-25|website=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The in-person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welk|first=Brian|date=2021-08-27|title=Oscars Academy Postpones All In-Person Events and Screenings Until 2022|url=https://www.thewrap.com/oscars-academy-postpones-all-in-person-events-and-screenings-until-2022/|access-date=2022-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligible films do not have to be added to the platform, but the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are.&lt;ref name=DeadlineScreeningRoom/&gt;

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)

The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all-time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212316/https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]]. NBC regained the rights for five years {{nowrap|(1971–75),}} then ABC resumed broadcast duties in [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |title=ABC Signs Expansive New Agreement to Broadcast The Oscars, Hollywood's Biggest Entertainment Ceremony, Through 2028 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=August 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.

The ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|NCAA basketball tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting with a Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=June 11, 2019|website=HuffPost|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212338/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The production of the Academy Awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that award's own launch in [[21st Academy Awards|1949]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html |title=Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Tom |last=O'Neil |date=July 12, 2010 |access-date=August 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819172053/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html |archive-date=August 19, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Furthermore, a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with [[National Football League]] playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-oscars-20101005 |title=Academy looks to move 2012 Oscar ceremony up several weeks |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=John |last=Horn |date=October 5, 2010 |access-date=February 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308124541/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-oscars-20101005 |archive-date=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late February to mid February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/news/academy-determines-new-oscars-category-merits-further-study |title=Academy Determines New Oscars Category Merits Further Study |date=September 5, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2019 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |quote=The Board of Governors also voted to move up the date of the 92nd Oscars telecast to Sunday, February 9, 2020, from the previously announced February 23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114100723/https://oscars.org/news/academy-determines-new-oscars-category-merits-further-study |archive-date=January 14, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the [[40th Academy Awards]] ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] On March 30, 1981, the [[53rd Academy Awards]] was postponed for one day, after [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|the shooting]] of President [[Ronald Reagan]] and others in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/arts/academy-awards-postponed-to-tonight.html|title=Academy Awards Postponed to Tonight|last=Lindsey|first=Robert|date=March 31, 1981|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 29, 2019|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212356/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/arts/academy-awards-postponed-to-tonight.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, an ''In Memoriam'' segment was introduced,&lt;ref name="fawcett"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett |title=Farrah Fawcett:Oscars director apologises for 'In Memoriam' omission |work=The Guardian |access-date=March 8, 2010 |location=London |first=Ben |last=Child |date=March 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414020632/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett |archive-date=April 14, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandy |last=Cohen |title=Oscar's 'In Memoriam' segment is touching to watch, painful to make |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2010-03-03-oscar-memorial-segment_N.htm |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=USA Today |date=March 3, 2010 |access-date=March 8, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306133003/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2010-03-03-oscar-memorial-segment_N.htm |archive-date=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a "[[popularity contest]]" feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). "Did you know?" ''Metro''.

Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped; the [[88th Academy Awards]] were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.&lt;ref name="variety-struggleabc"&gt;{{cite web |title=ABC's Oscar Contract Renegotiations: Who'll Get Creative Control? |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |website=Variety |date=March 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302000335/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |archive-date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.&lt;ref name="variety-2028"&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the Oscars Deal: What it Means for ABC and the Academy |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |website=Variety |date=September 2016 |access-date=September 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901184910/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |archive-date=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV ratings===
Historically, the telecast's viewership is higher when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award. More than 57.25&amp;nbsp;million viewers tuned to the telecast for the [[70th Academy Awards]] in 1998, the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US$600.8&amp;nbsp;million in the US, a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html |work=The Seattle Times |title=Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers |first=Meg |last=James |date=February 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115833/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html |archive-date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony, in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368&amp;nbsp;million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture, drew 43.56&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="usatoday_oscar"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers |date=January 26, 2005 |first=Scott |last=Bowles |access-date=November 8, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915033557/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm |archive-date=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Justin |last=Oppelaar |url=https://variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |title=Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by ''Variety'' |magazine=Variety |date=October 9, 2002 |access-date=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118083655/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |archive-date=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings, despite how much critical acclaim those films have received. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budget independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4&amp;nbsp;million) generated an audience of 38.64&amp;nbsp;million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm |title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party |work=USA Today |first=Gary |last=Levin |date=March 7, 2006 |access-date=April 14, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611173534/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm |archive-date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76&amp;nbsp;million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 |title=Oscar ratings worst ever |newspaper=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330005242/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080227%2FLIFE%2F802270307 |archive-date=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film (''[[No Country for Old Men]]'').

In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at [[The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]]. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles.

[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |title=Oscars Award Venues |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=April 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212063803/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |archive-date=December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]]. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre]] (1953) and then at the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]], after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], California, in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, this time to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]]. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine.

In 2002, Hollywood's [[Dolby Theatre]] (previously known as the Kodak Theatre) became the presentation's current venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oscars' home renamed Dolby Theatre |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |access-date=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502081049/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |archive-date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |title=Oscars Won't Televise All Awards, Adds Popular Film Category |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=August 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103125108/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |archive-date=November 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live. This followed several proposals (among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category) that the Academy had announced but did not implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |title=Academy Reverses Decision, Will Air All Awards at the 2019 Oscars |magazine=Time |access-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217185917/http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |archive-date=February 17, 2019 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Undue weight section|date=April 2016}}

===Accusations of commercialism===
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the "[[Oscar season]]." This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality. [[William Friedkin]], an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as "the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date=February 24, 2009 |title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |access-date=March 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310081013/http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |archive-date=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC's]] [[filmsite.org]], has written of the Academy Awards:

{{blockquote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking "formula-made" blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |title=Academy Awards – The Oscars |access-date=4 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120093333/http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |archive-date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the [[whisper campaign]]. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'' suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' distorts history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |title=Oscar's Dirty Tricks: Inside the Whisper Campaign Machine (Analysis) |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=December 20, 2012 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043347/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=March 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of bias===
{{further|Oscar bait}}
{{see also|Virtue signaling}}

Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. in the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. The term "[[Oscar bait]]" was coined to describe such movies. This has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring "Oscar bait" over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |access-date=January 24, 2012 |work=New York Post |first=Kyle |last=Smith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archive-date=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of a lack of diversity===
The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |title=In Hollywood, diversity tends to ignore the disabled |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 15, 2016 |access-date=April 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426062804/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |archive-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/24/oscars-diversity-debate-must-include-learning-disability|title=Oscars diversity debate must include learning disability|work=The Guardian|date=February 24, 2017|access-date=April 25, 2017|archive-date=November 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212317/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/24/oscars-diversity-debate-must-include-learning-disability|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |title=Oscars 2016: Lack of Diversity Has Historically Been a Problem |website=[[ABC News]] |access-date=April 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426150745/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |archive-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which shows us that only 6.4% of academy award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://labs.time.com/story/oscars-diversity/ |title=This Chart Proves the Oscars Have a Serious Diversity Problem |last=Berman |first=Eliza |magazine=Time |access-date=April 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430194958/http://labs.time.com/story/oscars-diversity/ |archive-date=April 30, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a variety of reasons, including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples, a number of high-profile Oscars have been given to [[Examples of yellowface|yellowface]] portrayals, as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america |title=Casting White People in Asian Roles Goes Back Centuries |access-date=May 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119135943/https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america |archive-date=January 19, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-times-the-oscars-honored-white-actors-for-playing-people-of-color_n_58aefe72e4b0140601306fe8 |title=11 Times The Oscars Honored White Actors For Playing People Of Color |work=HuffPost |first=Carolina |last=Moreno |date=24 February 2017 |access-date=May 22, 2019 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212314/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-times-the-oscars-honored-white-actors-for-playing-people-of-color_n_58aefe72e4b0140601306fe8 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, no Asian woman has ever won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/asian-performers-are-worthy-oscar-recognition-guest-column-941625/ | title=Asian Performers Are Worthy of Oscar Recognition, Too (Guest Column) | website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=October 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[88th Academy Awards|88th awards ceremony]] became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the [[hashtag]] #OscarsSoWhite, based on activists' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vliet |first=Hannah |date=2021-12-01 |title=White Saviors Get Gold Trophies: Colorblind Racism and Film Award Culture |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.1386/fm_00182_1 |journal=Film Matters |language=en |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=140–151 |doi=10.1386/fm_00182_1 |s2cid=247260533 |issn=2042-1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Academy initiated "historic" changes in membership by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sims |first=David |title=Can a Boycott Change the Oscars?

===Symbolism or sentimentalization===
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |title=What's the worst Best Actor choice of all time? |access-date=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make up for a "snub" for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded, or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.&lt;ref name="levy" /&gt;

===Recognition of streaming media film===
Following the [[91st Academy Awards]] in February 2019 in which the [[Netflix]]-broadcast film ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services. Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ |title=The Spielberg vs. Netflix Battle Could Mean Collateral Damage for Indies at the Oscars |first=Anna |last=Thompson |date=February 28, 2019 |access-date=April 24, 2019 |work=[[IndieWire]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320081430/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ |archive-date=March 20, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]], having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ |title=Justice Department Warns Academy Over Potential Oscar Rule Changes Threatening Netflix |first=Ted |last=Johnson |date=April 2, 2019 |access-date=April 24, 2019 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423210652/https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html |title=Academy doesn't change streaming eligibility for Oscars |first=Lisa |last=Respers France |date=April 24, 2019 |access-date=April 24, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424125530/https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html |archive-date=April 24, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusals of the award===
Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.&lt;ref name="DYK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=The Oscars Did You Know? |access-date=June 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000022/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archive-date=June 23, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.

[[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'') at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony. Scott described it as a "meat parade," saying, "I don't want any part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |work=BBC News |title=George C Scott: The man who refused an Oscar |date=September 23, 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095900/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |archive-date=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html |magazine=Time |title=Show Business: Meat Parade |date=March 8, 1971 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221203341/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C904789%2C00.html |archive-date=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=Fast Facts – Did You Know? |publisher=Biography.com |date=May 16, 1929 |access-date=February 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210075430/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archive-date=February 10, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third person to refuse the award was [[Marlon Brando]], who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando asked actress and [[civil rights activist]] [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech in his place, detailing his criticisms, for which there was [[booing]] and [[cheering]] by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Oscars |title=Marlon Brando's Oscar win for " The Godfather" |date=October 2, 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |access-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217152537/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |archive-date=February 17, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DYK" /&gt;

===Disqualifications===
Six films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73722/8-oscar-nominations-were-revoked |title=9 Oscar Nominations That Were Revoked |last=Obias |first=Rudie |website=mentalfloss.com |publisher=Mental Floss |date=February 23, 2019 |access-date=October 14, 2019 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116212356/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73722/8-oscar-nominations-were-revoked |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Circus (1928 film)|The Circus]]'' (1928) – The film was voluntarily removed by the Academy from competitive categories, to award [[Charlie Chaplin]] a special award.
* ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' (1953) – Removed from the Best Story ballot after letters from the producer and nominee questioned its inclusion in the category.
* ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955) – Withdrawn from screenwriting ballot after being mistaken for the [[High Society (1956 film)|1956 movie]] of the same title.
* ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) – Initially nominated for eleven awards, its nomination for Best Original Score was revoked after it was discovered that its main theme was very similar to music that [[Nino Rota|the score's composer]] had written for an earlier film. None of its other nominations were revoked, and it received three Oscars, including Best Picture.
* ''[[A Place in the World (film)|A Place in the World]]'' (1992) – Removed from the Best Foreign Language Film ballot after it was discovered that the country which submitted the film exercised insufficient artistic control.
* ''[[Alone Yet Not Alone]]'' (2014) – The film's title song, "Alone Yet Not Alone," was removed from the Best Original Song ballot after [[Bruce Broughton]] was found to have improperly contacted other members of the academy's musical branch; this was the first time that a film was removed from a ballot for ethical reasons.

One film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:
* ''[[Young Americans (1967 film)|Young Americans]]'' (1969) – Initially won the award for Best Documentary Feature, but was later revoked after it was revealed that it had opened theatrically prior to the eligibility period.

One film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar:
* ''[[Tuba Atlantic]]'' (2011) – Its nomination for Best Live Action Short Film was revoked when it was discovered that the film had aired on television in 2010, before its theatrical release.

==Presenter and performer gifts==
It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In recent years, these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners.&lt;ref name="ABCGiftBag"&gt;{{cite web |last=Valenti |first=Catherine |title=No Oscar?

The '''Grey Cup''' ({{lang-fr|Coupe Grey}}) is both the championship game of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) and the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing in the namesake championship of professional [[Canadian football]]. The game is contested between the winners of the CFL's [[East Division (CFL)|East]] and [[West Division (CFL)|West]] Divisional playoffs and is one of [[Canadian television]]'s largest annual sporting events. The [[Toronto Argonauts]] have the most Grey Cup wins (17) since its introduction in 1909, while the [[Edmonton Elks]] (formerly the Edmonton Eskimos) have the most Grey Cup wins (11) since the merger in 1958. The latest, the [[108th Grey Cup]], took place in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], on December 12, 2021, when the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] defeated the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] 33–25 in overtime.

The Grey Cup game is Canada's largest annual sports and television event, regularly drawing a Canadian viewing audience of about 4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Houston"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061220.wsptcfl20/TPStory/Sports/columnists |title=Grey Cup moves to TSN in new deal |access-date=2007-06-07 |last=Houston |first=William |date=December 20, 2006 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930064843/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061220.wsptcfl20/TPStory/Sports/columnists |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houston 2006-11-20"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061120.wspttruth20/GSStory/GlobeSportsFootball/home|title=Minor rise in Grey Cup ratings good for CBC|access-date=2006-12-03|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2006-11-20|author=William Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two awards are given for play in the game, [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] and the [[Dick Suderman Trophy]] as most valuable Canadian player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/greycup/mvp_top.html |title=MVP and Top Canadians|access-date=2008-01-20 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a member of the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]], [[Andrew Harris (Canadian football)|Andrew Harris]] is the only player to win both the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian and Most Valuable Player the same year, which he did in 2019.

The trophy was commissioned in 1909 by [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|The Earl Grey]], then [[Governor General of Canada|Canada's governor general]],  who originally hoped to donate it for the country's [[senior hockey|senior amateur hockey]] championship. After the [[Allan Cup]] was later donated for that purpose, Grey instead made his trophy available as the "[[Canadian Dominion Football Championship]]" (national championship) of Canadian football. The trophy has a silver [[chalice]] attached to a large base on which the names of all winning teams, players and executives are engraved. The Grey Cup has been broken on several occasions, stolen twice, and held for ransom. It survived a 1947 fire that destroyed numerous artifacts housed in the same building.

The Grey Cup was first won by the [[University of Toronto Varsity Blues]]. Play was suspended from 1916 to 1918 due to the [[World War I|First World War]] and in 1919 due to a rules dispute. The game has typically been contested in an east-versus-west format since the 1920s. The game was always played on a Saturday until 1968, but since 1969 (except for 1970) has always been on a Sunday. Held in late November (in some years in early December, most recently in 2021), and mostly in outdoor stadiums, the Grey Cup has been played in inclement weather at times, including the 1950 "[[38th Grey Cup|Mud Bowl]]", in which a player reportedly came close to drowning in a puddle, then the 1962 "[[50th Grey Cup|Fog Bowl]]", when the final minutes of the game had to be postponed to the following day due to a heavy fog, and the 1977 "[[65th Grey Cup|Ice Bowl]]", contested on the frozen-over artificial turf at [[Montreal]]'s [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]]. Most recently, in the [[105th Grey Cup|2017 game]] snow fell, at times heavily, throughout the game.

The then-Edmonton Eskimos formed the Grey Cup's longest [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]], winning five consecutive championships from 1978 to 1982.  Competition for the trophy has been exclusively between Canadian teams, except for a three-year period from 1993 to 1995, when an expansion of the CFL south into the United States resulted in the [[Baltimore Stallions]] winning the 1995 championship and taking the Grey Cup south of the border for the only time in its history.

==History==

===National championships before 1909===
Serious efforts to organize a national governing body and eventually a Dominion championship for what at that time was still a game called and practically identical to [[rugby union]] began in the early 1880s, culminating in the creation of the Canadian Rugby Union in 1891 and the first CRU-recognized national championship the following year. After that, [[Football Canada#Champions prior to 1909|national championship games]] were held every year prior to the creation of the Grey Cup except 1899, 1903 and 1904.

===Creation and early years (1909–1921)===
[[File:Albert Grey.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Earl Grey donated the Grey Cup in 1909.|alt=Upper body of a bald man with a large moustache.  He is in a military uniform with several medals pinned to his left chest.]]
While the [[Stanley Cup]] was created in 1893 as the Canadian amateur hockey championship, professional teams were openly competing for the trophy by 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|Zweig|Duplacey|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], the [[Governor General of Canada]], planned to donate a new trophy to serve as the senior amateur championship; however, [[H. Montagu Allan|Sir Montague Allan]] donated the [[Allan Cup]] before he could finalize his plans. Grey instead offered an award for the Canadian amateur rugby football championship beginning in 1909.&lt;ref name="Kelly11"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1999|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially failed to follow through on his offer; the trophy was not ordered until two weeks prior to the first championship game.&lt;ref name="CFHOF"&gt;{{citation |url=http://cfhof.ca/history-of-the-grey-cup/ |title=History of the Grey Cup |publisher=Canadian Football Hall of Fame and Museum |access-date=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1st Grey Cup|first Grey Cup]] game was held on December 4, 1909, between two Toronto clubs: the [[Toronto Varsity Blues|University of Toronto Varsity Blues]] defeated the [[Toronto Parkdale|Parkdale Canoe Club]] 26–6 before 3,800 fans.&lt;ref name="Theile13"&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy was not ready for presentation following the game, and the Varsity Blues did not receive it until March 1910.&lt;ref name="CFHOF" /&gt; They retained the trophy in the following two years, defeating the [[Hamilton Tigers (football)|Hamilton Tigers]] in [[2nd Grey Cup|1910]] and the [[Toronto Argonauts]] in [[3rd Grey Cup|1911]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Toronto failed to reach the [[4th Grey Cup|1912 Grey Cup]], which was won by the [[Hamilton Alerts]] over the Argonauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Varsity Blues refused to hand over the trophy on the belief they could keep it until they were defeated in a title game. They kept the trophy until [[6th Grey Cup|1914]] when they were defeated by the Argonauts, who made the trophy available to subsequent champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's participation in [[World War I]] resulted in the cancellation of the championship from 1916 to 1918, during which time the Cup was forgotten. ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' writer Bob Dunn claimed that the trophy was later rediscovered as "one of the family heirlooms" of an employee of the Toronto trust company where it had been sent for storage.&lt;ref name="Theile4"&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grey Cup game was also cancelled in 1919 due to a lack of interest from the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU) and the intercollegiate unions, along with rules conflicts between the [[Football Canada|Canadian Rugby Union]] (CRU) and the western union; Canada was still struggling in its recovery from the [[Spanish flu]] epidemic that occurred during the last months of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1910 |title=Grey Cup History Timeline 1910 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-06-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819234629/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1910 |archive-date=2012-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition finally resumed in 1920 with the [[8th Grey Cup]] game, won 16–3 by the Varsity Blues over the Argonauts. It was the University of Toronto's fourth, and final, championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western participation (1922–1932)===
Competition for the Grey Cup was limited to member unions of the CRU, the champions of which petitioned the league body for the right to challenge for the national championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mfAuAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5175,5501187 |title=Canadian Rugby Union refuses to accept Regina's challenge |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1936-12-04 |access-date=2012-08-12 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BigStick"&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D7BUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7450,330559 |title=Big-stick proposal offered |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1957-03-02 |access-date=2012-08-12 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[West Division (CFL)#Pre-1936|Western Canada Rugby Football Union]] (WCRFU) was formed in 1911, but the CRU did not come to a participation agreement with it until 1921, allowing the [[Edmonton Rugby Foot-ball Club|Edmonton Eskimos]] (no lineage to the [[Edmonton Elks|team that used that name]] 1949–2020) of the WCRFU to challenge.&lt;ref name="1920Timeline"&gt;{{citation |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1920 |title=Grey Cup History Timeline 1920 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819234634/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1920 |archive-date=2012-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the Argonauts in the [[9th Grey Cup]], the Eskimos became the first western team{{snd}}and the first from outside Toronto or Hamilton{{snd}}to compete for the trophy.&lt;ref name="CFL9thGC"&gt;{{citation |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/1921gc |title=Grey Cup 1921 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512150742/http://greycup.cfl.ca/1921gc |archive-date=2012-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argonauts entered the game with an undefeated record, having outscored their opposition 226 to 55 during the season.  They dominated Edmonton, recording the first [[shutout]] in Grey Cup history with a 23–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-sport star [[Lionel Conacher]] was Toronto's top player, scoring 15 of his team's points before leaving the game after the third quarter to join his hockey team for their game.&lt;ref name="CFL9thGC" /&gt;  The same Edmonton team (renamed as Edmonton Elks) challenged for the trophy again in [[10th Grey Cup|1922]], but lost 13–1 to their eastern opposition, the [[Queen's Golden Gaels|Queen's University Golden Gaels]].  For Queen's, it was the first of three consecutive titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western teams continued to vie for the trophy, but were consistently outclassed for several years.  Eastern teams and critics felt the quality of the western game was inferior to theirs, and when Queen's defeated the [[Regina Rugby Club]] 54–0 in the [[11th Grey Cup|1923 final]], the critics felt they deliberately ran up the score to prove that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regina was western Canada's dominant team, appearing in the Grey Cup on six occasions between 1928 and 1934, but lost to their eastern opponents each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regina helped revolutionize Canadian football in [[17th Grey Cup|1929]], however, as they attempted the first [[forward pass]] in Grey Cup history.&lt;ref name="1920Timeline" /&gt; The Winnipeg 'Pegs (now the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers|Blue Bombers]]) became the first western Grey Cup champion in [[23rd Grey Cup|1935]] when they defeated the Hamilton Tigers, 18–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Grey Cup was slow to achieve national popularity,&lt;ref name="CanEncyFogBowl"&gt;{{citation |last=Marsh |first=James H. |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/featured/fog-bowl |title=Fog Bowl |publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute |access-date=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the advent of the east versus west format helped make the game the nation's largest sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tYotAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3200,5418901 |title=That November Madness |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1959-11-28 |access-date=2012-08-14 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ru1kAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1799,4438940 |title=1960 Grey Cup trip recalls first Eskimo venture in 1921 |work=Edmonton Journal |date=1960-11-23 |access-date=2012-08-14 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progress towards professionalism (1933–1956)===
[[File:Grey Cup VPL 43916 (15892818281).jpg|thumb|left|175px|Woman poses with Grey Cup in 1955.]]
As the quality of senior football improved, university teams realized they were no longer able to compete on equal footing and withdrew from competition for the Grey Cup in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, only three unions continued to compete under the banner of the CRU: the IRFU (now commonly known as the Big Four) and the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] (ORFU) in the east, and the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] (WIFU) in the west.&lt;ref name="Gazette1986History"&gt;{{citation |last=Bacon |first=Dick |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2pA0AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1521,5496235 |title=From the mud bowl to the fog bowl, there's nothing quite like... The Grey Cup |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1986-11-29 |access-date=2012-07-01 |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRU experimented with a two-game, total points series to determine the champion in [[28th Grey Cup|1940]].  The [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] won both games against Toronto's [[Toronto Balmy Beach Beachers|Balmy Beach]], 8–2 and 12–5. The Grey Cup returned to its one-game format the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Big Four and WIFU suspended operations in 1942 due to the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Timeline1940s"&gt;{{citation |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1940 |title=Grey Cup History Timeline 1940 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820235902/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1940 |archive-date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey Cup play was expected to be suspended along with the unions; however, the military felt the game and sport would serve as a morale booster and organized teams at bases across the country.&lt;ref name="Theile1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the following three years, Grey Cup competition was limited to military teams, and in the [[30th Grey Cup|1942 Grey Cup]], the [[Toronto RCAF Hurricanes]] defeated the [[Winnipeg RCAF Bombers]] 8–5 to become the first non-civilian team to win the national championship.&lt;ref name="Theile1997" /&gt; Two years later, the [[St. Hyacinthe–Donnacona Navy]] defeated the [[Hamilton Flying Wildcats]], 7–6; no Grey Cup championship since then has featured two eastern teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the war led to the reformation of civilian teams; the Big Four resumed play in 1945, and the WIFU the following year.&lt;ref name="Timeline1940s" /&gt;

A push by the sport's organizers to adopt an increasingly professional attitude dominated the post-war period: poor field conditions, previously accepted as part of the game, resulted in numerous complaints against the CRU following the [[37th Grey Cup|1949]] and [[38th Grey Cup|1950]] Grey Cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field conditions at Toronto's [[Varsity Stadium]] were so poor in 1950 that the game has since gained infamy as the "Mud Bowl".&lt;ref name="MudBowl60th"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.argonauts.ca/article/60-years-later-mud-bowl |title=60 years later: Mud Bowl |publisher=Toronto Argonauts Football Club |date=2010-11-25 |access-date=2012-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212092124/http://argonauts.ca/article/60-years-later-mud-bowl |archive-date=2010-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ruts in the field and poor weather in the days leading up to the game resulted in a sloppy field covered in large puddles of water. The game also gained notoriety for the near drowning of Winnipeg's [[Buddy Tinsley]], who was found face down in a large puddle, apparently unconscious. Tinsley later said that he had not lost consciousness, but his leg had gone numb from a hard hit to a preexisting injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toronto won the game 13–0, the last time a team has been shut out in a Grey Cup game.&lt;ref name="MudBowl60th" /&gt;

[[File:1956 Grey Cup victory.jpg|thumb|[[Don Getty]], future [[Premier of Alberta]], celebrates with the Grey Cup after the Eskimos' 1956 championship.|alt=A man with short hair in a white football uniform drinks out of a large silver cup.]]
The ORFU, the last purely amateur union competing for the Grey Cup, withdrew from Cup competition in 1954.  Although the Big Four and WIFU champions had faced each other in the Grey Cup final since 1945, the ORFU's withdrawal left the IRFU and WIFU unchallenged as Canada's top football unions.&lt;ref name="Timeline1950s"&gt;{{citation|url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1950 |title=Grey Cup History Timeline 1950 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820235902/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1950 |archive-date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Eskimos faced the [[Montreal Alouettes]] in three consecutive Grey Cups in the mid-1950s, winning all three.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jones |first=Terry |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/GreyCup/2005/11/25/1323064-sun.html |title=A matchup for the ages |work=Edmonton Sun |date=2005-11-25 |access-date=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonton's first title in 1954 ended in bizarre fashion after [[Jackie Parker]] scored a touchdown (converted by Bob Dean) from a fumble recovery late in the game that gave Edmonton a 26–25 lead.  At the time in Canadian football, touchdowns were only worth 5 points.  Parker's 90-yard fumble return was the longest in league history until Toronto's Cassius Vaughn returned a Calgary fumble 109 yards in the 2017 Grey Cup game which was won by Toronto. The 1954 game also marked the end of the amateur era as the top teams completed their transition to professional organizations.&lt;ref name="Theile97"&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1950s wore on, the Big Four and WIFU distanced themselves from the CRU, forming the Canadian Football Council in 1956 to administer the game at the professional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, on January 18, 1958, the CFC withdrew from the CRU and the Big Four &amp; WIFU merged into the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). The new league formally assumed control of the Grey Cup from the CRU.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Vickery |first=Al |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9xYvAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7048%2C2776041 |title=Canadian football loop formed; takes over Grey Cup |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1958-01-18 |access-date=2012-07-01 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Football League kicks off (1957–1969)===
In the CFL's initial seasons, the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] were the league's dominant team, appearing in nine Grey Cups and winning four titles between 1957 and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Winnipeg Blue Bombers opposed Hamilton on six of those occasions, winning four titles.&lt;ref name="Gazette1986History" /&gt; The two teams were involved in a series of bizarre incidents, the first occurring during the [[45th Grey Cup|1957 Grey Cup]].&lt;ref name="Kelly118"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1999|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto-based lawyer and fan David Humphrey had talked his way past stadium security and had been allowed to watch the game from the sidelines.&lt;ref name="HumphreyObit"&gt;{{citation |last=Hall |first=Joseph |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/636710 |title=David G.

That rule remained the CFL standard into the 2000s.&lt;ref name="ESZebras" /&gt; Winnipeg scored the lone touchdown in overtime to defeat Hamilton 21–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Friesen |first=Paul |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/GreyCup/2006/11/13/2339461.html |title=Top 10 greatest Grey Cups |work=Winnipeg Sun |date=2006-11-13 |access-date=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winnipeg and Hamilton met again in 1962, the [[50th Grey Cup]], immortalized as the "Fog Bowl".&lt;ref name="CBC2006GreatestGCs" /&gt;  The game was held at Toronto's [[Exhibition Stadium]], and began on Saturday, December 1, 1962.  The fog rolled in early in the second quarter and became increasingly dense as the game progressed.&lt;ref name="Kelly134"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1999|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the fourth quarter, the players were unable to see the sideline markers and the fans unable to see the play.&lt;ref name="CBC2006GreatestGCs" /&gt;  The players were unable to see the ball in the air – kick returners listened for the sound of the ball hitting the ground – and the action was largely invisible to the television audience.&lt;ref name="CanEncyFogBowl" /&gt;  With nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds remaining in the game and Winnipeg holding onto a 28–27 lead, officials made the unprecedented decision to suspend play until the next day.&lt;ref name="Kelly134" /&gt; Though the league feared that continuing fog on the morning of December 2 would force the complete abandonment of the game, it lifted in time for the contest to resume.  Around 15,000 of the original 32,655 spectators watched Winnipeg win the Grey Cup without further scoring by either team.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Peacock |first=Jim |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MoEuAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6740%2C328067 |title=Fog-hit Grey Cup classic in Toronto nearly washed out as no contest |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1962-12-03 |access-date=2012-07-02 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first title game completed on a Sunday;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1960 |title=Grey Cup History Timeline 1960 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820235955/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1960 |archive-date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Grey Cup moved from its traditional Saturday start to Sunday in 1969; however, the game was played on a Saturday for the last time in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4GlkAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3276,1711652 |title=Montreal stadium selected for 1969 Grey Cup game |work=Calgary Herald |date=1968-06-07 |access-date=2012-08-10 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saskatchewan Roughriders won their first ever Grey Cup in [[54th Grey Cup|1966]] when they defeated the Ottawa Rough Riders 29–14 at Empire Stadium in Vancouver before 36,553 fans.

===Eskimos' dynasty (1970–1988)===
The Montreal Alouettes' [[58th Grey Cup|1970 Grey Cup]] championship, an upset win over the favoured [[Calgary Stampeders]], served as a morale booster for the city of Montreal, which was reeling in the aftermath of the [[October Crisis]].&lt;ref name="Gazette1986History" /&gt;  The 1970s belonged to the Edmonton Eskimos, however, as they ended the decade as one of the most dominant teams in CFL history,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1999|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching the Grey Cup nine times between 1973 and 1982.&lt;ref name="GreyCupRecords"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/2011/Grey_Cup_Record_Book_2011.pdf |title=Grey Cup record book, 2011 |publisher=Canadian Football League |year=2011 |access-date=2012-07-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419071354/http://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/2011/Grey_Cup_Record_Book_2011.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team competed in three consecutive finals early in the decade, losing to Ottawa in [[61st Grey Cup|1973]] and Montreal in [[62nd Grey Cup|1974]], before winning the franchise's fourth championship in [[63rd Grey Cup|1975]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|pp=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 championship was held in Calgary and was the first Grey Cup played on the [[Canadian Prairies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1970 |title=Grey Cup History Timeline 1970 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-07-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821000348/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1970 |archive-date=2012-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A young woman infamously [[Streaking|streaked]] across the field during the national anthem despite frigid temperatures well below freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/toronto/story.html?id=42ac1e6d-6352-4ab8-9a67-441670f85b39&amp;k=48495 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130094452/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/toronto/story.html?id=42ac1e6d-6352-4ab8-9a67-441670f85b39&amp;k=48495 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-30 |title=Dealing with the naked truth |work=National Post |access-date=2012-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only time the Eskimos did not reach the Grey Cup final during this span was in [[64th Grey Cup|1976]], when the Saskatchewan Roughriders met the Ottawa Rough Riders, in the final all-"Roughriders" Grey Cup game. Both teams fought a see-saw battle, which was decided in the dying seconds of the game when Ottawa quarterback [[Tom Clements]] threw to [[Tony Gabriel]], which stood out as the winning touchdown, 23–20. The [[65th Grey Cup|1977 Grey Cup]] was the first held at [[Olympic Stadium]] in Montreal, contested by the home town Alouettes and the Eskimos in front of a record crowd of 68,318.&lt;ref name="GreyCupRecords" /&gt; The game became known as the "Ice Bowl", as low temperatures froze snow on the field that had been melted by groundskeepers with salt, making the [[artificial turf]] extremely slippery. The Alouettes adapted to the field conditions by affixing staples to the soles of their shoes, improving their traction, and won the game by a 41–6 score.&lt;ref name="Gazette1986History" /&gt;

Upset at losing the 1977 game under poor weather conditions, the Eskimos hoped for a rematch with Montreal in [[66th Grey Cup|1978]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1999|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams reached the final game, which Edmonton won 20–13.  It was the first of five consecutive championships, a streak that remains unmatched in the history of the Grey Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eskimos' [[Dynasty (sports)|dynasty]] dominated the league, losing a total of only six games during the three seasons from 1979 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[69th Grey Cup|1981 Grey Cup]] was expected to be yet another easy win for Edmonton, who posted a 14–1–1 record during the season and were considered overwhelming favourites against the surprise Eastern champions, the 5–11 Ottawa Rough Riders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first half did not go as Edmonton hoped, though, as Ottawa, led by rookie quarterback [[J.C. Watts]], emerged with a 20–1 lead.  Quarterback [[Warren Moon]] led the Eskimos back in the second half, and with the game tied at 23, [[Dave Cutler (Canadian football)|Dave Cutler]] kicked the game-winning field goal with just three seconds remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bacon |first=Dick |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tUIwAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1456%2C2076374 |title=Esks rally for record Grey Cup win |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1981-11-23 |access-date=2012-07-02 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmonton's championship run came to an end in [[71st Grey Cup|1983]] when they lost in the West Semi-Final game; the Argonauts defeated the [[BC Lions]] to win the championship that year, ending the team's 31-year Grey Cup title drought.&lt;ref name="GreyCupRecords" /&gt; Despite Toronto's win, the CFL felt that the overall quality of play in the East Division had deteriorated compared to that of the West.  In 1986, it altered the playoff format to allow the first non-playoff team in one division to take the last playoff spot, but stay in their division if they had a better record.  The consequences of the new rules were felt immediately, as the league gave a playoff spot to the Stampeders having a better record than the Alouettes, and decided the East Division Final would be a 2-game-total-point Final between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who finished first and second, respectively. The crossover, if necessary, would begin in 1987. In financial difficulty, the loss of the playoff spot was disastrous for Montreal, which ceased operations one year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crossover rule was eliminated and not revisited until a decade later due to Montreal's folding (ironically, the crossover rule returned with the Alouettes' revival). Reduced to eight teams, the CFL shifted Winnipeg to the East Division, making the [[76th Grey Cup|1988 Grey Cup]] between the Blue Bombers and Lions the first championship game between two [[Western Canada|western Canadian]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CFL USA (1989–1995)===
The [[77th Grey Cup|1989 Grey Cup]] is considered one of the finest games in Canadian football history:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2006TenGreatest"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/winnipeg/story.html?id=534dffdf-8cff-4698-b1db-6ed2ae6adb95 |title=10 greatest Grey Cups of all time |work=Vancouver Sun |date=2006-11-18 |access-date=2012-07-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032125/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/winnipeg/story.html?id=534dffdf-8cff-4698-b1db-6ed2ae6adb95 |archive-date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saskatchewan Roughriders won their second championship by defeating the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 43–40 in the highest scoring Grey Cup game of all-time.&lt;ref name="GreyCupRecords" /&gt; Saskatchewan kicker [[Dave Ridgway]]'s last-second field goal won the game and made him a legend in the prairie province.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Busby |first=Ian |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/GreyCup/2009/11/29/11970171-sun.html |title=Ridgway win in cards for kicker Congi? |publisher=Sun Media |date=2009-11-29 |access-date=2012-07-04 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Declining interest in the CFL during the 1990s left the league in financial difficulty. Hoping to restore the league's credibility with fans, a new ownership group featuring [[Bruce McNall]], hockey player [[Wayne Gretzky]] and actor [[John Candy]] purchased the Toronto Argonauts in 1991 and lured American college standout [[Raghib Ismail|Rocket Ismail]] to Canada with a four-year, $26.2&amp;nbsp;million contract which made him the highest paid player in football history at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1060799.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018220542/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1060799.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-10-18 |title=Ismail Signs $26.2 Million Deal to Rocket to Canada |work=The Washington Post |date=1991-04-21 |access-date=2012-07-04}}{{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argonauts reached the [[79th Grey Cup|1991 Grey Cup]] and defeated the Calgary Stampeders 36–21.  With 261 all-purpose yards on the game, including a then-Grey Cup record 87-yard [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] return for a touchdown, Ismail was named [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for the league to enter the American market was discussed in 1987 when operators of the defunct [[United States Football League]] approached the CFL about merging the two leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3811251.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194824/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3811251.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-03-09 |title=New football league hope slim // CFL 'lukewarm' to merger with the defunct USFL |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1987-02-18 |access-date=2012-07-04}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league showed little interest at the time, but as it continued its decline, the CFL reevaluated its position. In 1992, the CFL announced that it would [[Canadian Football League in the United States|expand into the United States]]. The [[Sacramento Gold Miners]] joined the league and became the first American team eligible to win the Grey Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Domowitch |first=Paul |title=CFL begins living the American dream |work=Philadelphia Daily News |date=1994-07-07 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league added three additional American teams in 1994 and two in 1995 (with one team folding), but the initiative failed in most markets, and by 1996, the CFL again operated exclusively within Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lone successful American market was in Baltimore, home to the [[Baltimore Stallions|Stallions]].  The team averaged over 35,000 fans per game in its inaugural season, nearly double that of Toronto or Hamilton. They matched that success on the field by becoming the first American team to play in the Grey Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Swardson |first=Anne |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-920317.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808120037/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-920317.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-08-08 |title=Canadian Football Unhorsed;Northerners Decry Threat by Baltimore Non-Colts to Run Off With Revered Grey Cup |work=The Washington Post |date=1994-11-22 |access-date=2012-07-04}}{{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BC Lions kept the Grey Cup in Canada with a 26–23 victory in the [[82nd Grey Cup|1994 final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baltimore returned to the title game [[83rd Grey Cup|one year later]] and became the only American team to win the trophy by defeating the Calgary Stampeders, 37–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theile|1997|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|relocation]] of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Cleveland Browns]] to Baltimore (to become the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]) in 1996 caused the Stallions to seek a new city to avoid direct competition with an NFL team.

The [[93rd Grey Cup|2005 Grey Cup]] was the second overtime game in Grey Cup history, and the first one using the league's shootout overtime format (introduced in 2000). Both the Eskimos and Alouettes scored touchdowns on their first possessions, while Edmonton scored a field goal in its second and held Montreal scoreless to win the game by a 38–35 score.&lt;ref name="2006TenGreatest" /&gt; The game was played in the middle of a stretch of eight Grey Cup appearances by the Alouettes between 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref name="GreyCupRecords" /&gt;  In [[97th Grey Cup|2009]], they defeated the Roughriders in dramatic fashion: placekicker [[Damon Duval]] missed a last-second field goal attempt that appeared to give Saskatchewan the victory.

His second attempt was successful, giving Montreal a 28–27 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=300347 |title=Alouettes capitalize on Riders' penalty to win 97th Grey Cup |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2009-11-30 |access-date=2012-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910200930/http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=300347 |archive-date=2011-09-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[100th Grey Cup]] game was played on November 25, 2012, at the [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto between the Toronto Argonauts and the Calgary Stampeders.

As per a new title sponsorship deal with [[Shaw Communications]] announced in May 2015, the event was thenceforth known as the '''Grey Cup presented by Shaw'''.&lt;ref name="global-shawgreycupdeal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaw, CFL announce Grey Cup sponsorship deal|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1988297/shaw-cfl-announce-grey-cup-sponsorship-deal/|access-date=2 October 2015|work=Global News|publisher=Shaw Media|date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2020, due to postponement of the regular season and other factors relating to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], it was announced that the [[108th Grey Cup]] festivities in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] (which were to be the first to be hosted by the new [[Mosaic Stadium]]) had been cancelled and postponed to 2022, and that the site of the game, if held, would be based on regular season records rather than as a [[Home advantage#Neutral venues|neutral site]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|title=CFL eyes September return, changes Grey Cup format|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-eyes-september-return-1.5577178|date=2020-05-20|website=CBC News|access-date=2020-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grey Cup itself was later cancelled in August along with the [[2020 CFL season]], which was the first year that the Grey Cup was not contested since 1919.

The trophy is customarily escorted to the new champions by two members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and presented by the commissioner of the CFL.

Similar to the more famous [[Stanley Cup]] used exclusively today by the NHL, members of the winning teams are allowed time to celebrate with the trophy in their own fashion, often taking it to their home towns or tours in locations across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Beamish |first=Mike |title=Mr. Grey goes where no Cup has gone before |work=Vancouver Sun |date=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board of directors for the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] act as the Grey Cup's trustees and control its rental for events.

Canadian television was in its infancy in 1952 when Toronto's [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] paid $7,500 for the rights to carry the first televised broadcast of a Grey Cup game.&lt;ref name="TSTelevision"&gt;{{citation |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/426219361.html?FMT=ABS |title=Grey Cup still Canada's No. 1 TV show |work=Toronto Star |date=2001-11-25 |access-date=2012-07-11 |page=S5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years, it was estimated that 80 percent of the nation's 900,000 television sets were tuned into the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dufrense |first=Bernard |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=veIwAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5681,3290647 |title=TV, radio coverage tops in grid classic |work=Ottawa Sun |date=1954-11-26 |access-date=2012-07-11 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the first national telecast did not occur until 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1950 |title=Grey Cup History Timeline 1950 |publisher=Canadian Football League |access-date=2012-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820235902/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1950 |archive-date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grey Cup continues to be one of Canada's most-viewed sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Shah |first=Maryam |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/07/07/toronto-argonaut-fans-are-go |title=Toronto Argonaut fans are go |work=Toronto Sun |date=2012-07-07 |access-date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1962 "[[50th Grey Cup|Fog Bowl]]" game was the first Grey Cup to be broadcast on American television.&lt;ref name="Gazette1986History" /&gt;

The CBC carried the first national telecasts exclusively, but the [[CTV Television Network]] purchased rights to the 1962 game. The move sparked concern across Canada as the newly formed network was not yet available in many parts of the country.&lt;ref name="TSTelevision" /&gt; The debate over whether an "event of national interest" should be broadcast by the publicly funded CBC or private broadcasters reached the floor of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] as members of the federal government weighed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Campbell |first=Norman |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=of0xAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7149,4587028 |title=Grey Cup—TV showdown? |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1961-02-21 |access-date=2012-07-11 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided that both networks would carry the game.&lt;ref name="TSTelevision" /&gt; The two networks continued with the [[simulcast]] arrangement until 1986 when CTV ceased its coverage.&lt;ref name="CFNStart"&gt;{{citation |last=Hunter |first=Paul |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/470483311.html?FMT=ABS |title=TV revenues less than expected so CFL teams face bigger losses |work=Toronto Star |date=1989-03-14 |access-date=2012-07-12 |page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFL operated the [[Canadian Football Network]], a coalition of private broadcasters that shared league games and the Grey Cup with the CBC, from 1987 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Anderson |first=Bill |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/514460041.html?FMT=ABS |title=Grey Cup still has some shine: Large TV audience expected |work=Kitchener-Waterloo Record |date=1990-11-24 |access-date=2012-07-12 |page=E10}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBC then broadcast the championship game alone until 2007, when the CFL sold exclusive rights to all games, including the Grey Cup, to specialty channel [[The Sports Network]] (TSN) and its French-language sister station [[Réseau des sports]] (RDS), a deal that was criticized by Canadians without cable access.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Graham |first=Jennifer |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/541869 |title=CFL fan laments loss of 'free' Grey Cup |work=Toronto Star |date=2008-11-22 |access-date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, TSN and RDS achieved a record audience for the 2009 Grey Cup, with 6.1&amp;nbsp;million Canadians watching the game in its entirety, and over 14&amp;nbsp;million viewing at least part of the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=300593 |title=Grey Cup delivers a record audience of 6.1 million viewers |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2009-12-01 |access-date=2012-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204133751/http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=300593 |archive-date=2009-12-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewership has declined in recent years, and in 2014, about 33%, of Canadians watched at least some of the game, peaking at 5.1&amp;nbsp;million viewers in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Zelkovich, [https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/drop-in-grey-cup-ratings-doesn-t-spell-doom-for-the-cfl-180806741.html The Great Canadian ratings report: Drop in Grey Cup audience follows CFL's downward trend], Yahoo Sports, December 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history; prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricket-worldcup2015.net/2015/02/trophy-is-first-permanent-prize-in-cricket-world-cup.html|publisher=cricket-worldcup2015.net|title=Trophy is first permanent prize in Cricket World Cup's history|accessdate=9 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203150018/http://www.cricket-worldcup2015.net/2015/02/trophy-is-first-permanent-prize-in-cricket-world-cup.html|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy was designed by Paul Marsden of Garrard &amp; co and produced in [[London]] by a team of craftsmen from [[Garrard &amp; Co]] over a period of two months. The trophy is now manufactured by Ottewill Silversmiths in [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/820941| title = The making of the ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The current trophy is made from silver and gold and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] and [[bail (cricket)|bails]], represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: [[batting (cricket)|batting]], [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]], while the globe characterises a [[cricket ball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.webindia123.com/Sports/cricket/iccworldcup/history.htm |publisher=webindia123.com|title=Cricket World Cup- Past Glimpses|accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands 60&amp;nbsp;cm high and weighs approximately 11.0567&amp;nbsp;kilograms. The names of the previous winners are [[engraving|engraved]] on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions.

The original trophy is kept by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]]. A replica which only differs in inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.&lt;ref name=cwctrophy&gt;{{cite web|title=Big money for winner of World Cup 2007|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/04/11/spo01.asp|accessdate=12 January 2012|work=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)]]|date=11 April 2007|first=Elmo|last=Rodrigopulle|publisher=[[Cabinet of Sri Lanka]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019054344/http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/04/11/spo01.asp|archivedate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lk2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle for World cricket supremacy|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/04/28/fea53.asp|first=Lionel|last=Wijesiri|accessdate=12 January 2012|work=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)]]|date=28 April 2011|publisher=[[Cabinet of Sri Lanka]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019054522/http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/04/28/fea53.asp|archivedate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cricket World Cup Trophies.jpg|thumb|From left to right:All the official trophies of Cricket World Cup from 1975-Present]]
[[Image:Prudential Cup.jpg|thumb|150px|Prudential Cup trophy]]
The Prudential Cups trophy were awarded to the winners of the World Cup from 1975 to 1983 when [[Prudential plc]] was the primary sponsor. The trophies' designs changed when the sponsors changed until the [[1999 ICC Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]]. So the first three world cups had a similar trophy while 1987 (Reliance World Cup sponsored by [[Reliance Industries]]), 1992 (Benson and Hedges Cup, sponsored by [[Benson and Hedges]]), and 1996 (Wills World Cup, sponsored by [[W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills|Wills]], an [[ITC Limited|ITC]] brand) had different trophies because of different sponsors until the [[International Cricket Council]] decided to award its own trophy.&lt;ref name=dawn2011&gt;{{cite news|title=How limited-overs cricket led to birth of World Cup|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/02/09/how-limited-overs-cricket-led-to-birth-of-world-cup.html|accessdate=4 April 2011|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ibn2011&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup sponsorship v prize money|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/factbox--world-cup-sponsorship-v-prize-money/625751.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014190937/http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/factbox--world-cup-sponsorship-v-prize-money/625751.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 October 2012|publisher=IBNLive.com|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trophy was created for the [[1999 ICC Cricket World Cup|1999 championships]] and is the first permanent prize in the tournament's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricket-worldcup2015.net/2015/02/trophy-is-first-permanent-prize-in-cricket-world-cup.html|work=cricket-worldcup2015.net|title=Trophy is first permanent prize in Cricket World Cup's history|accessdate=9 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203150018/http://www.cricket-worldcup2015.net/2015/02/trophy-is-first-permanent-prize-in-cricket-world-cup.html|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy was designed and produced in [[London]] by a team of craftsmen from [[Garrard &amp; Co]] (the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewellers]]). The whole process was completed over a period of two months time.

The '''ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy''' is presented to the winning team of the [[ICC Cricket World Cup]].
The current trophy is 60&amp;nbsp;cm high, is made from [[silver]] and [[gilding|gold]], and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: [[Batting (cricket)|batting]], [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[Fielding (cricket)|fielding]], while the globe characterises a [[cricket ball]], with the seam that is tilted to represent [[Axial tilt]] of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.webindia123.com/Sports/cricket/iccworldcup/history.htm |work=webindia123.com|title=Cricket World Cup- Past Glimpses|accessdate=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed with [[platonic solid|platonic dimensions]], so that it can be easily recognised from any angle. The trophy weighs approximately 11&amp;nbsp;kilograms and has the names of the previous winners inscribed on its base. There is still room for another ten teams to have their name inscribed:

The [[1987 Cricket World Cup|Reliance World Cup]] and [[1996 Cricket World Cup|Wills World Cup]] were crafted by Amit Pabuwal of [[Jaipur]] who has also made the world's largest gold trophy, the most expensive trophy in world history, as well as the [[T20 World Cup]].

===Status===
The actual trophy is kept by the [[International Cricket Council]] in its offices in [[Dubai]] but a replica, which is identical in all aspects apart from the inscription of the previous champions, is awarded to the winning team and remains in their possession.

'''The Football Association Challenge Cup''', more commonly known as the '''FA Cup''', is an annual [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] [[association football|football]] competition in men's domestic [[Football in England|English football]]. First played during the [[1871–72 FA Cup|1871–72 season]], it is the [[list of oldest football competitions|oldest national football competition]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29598744|title=Oldest football cup 'not for sale'|date=14 October 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=4 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105114055/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29598744|archive-date=5 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is organised by and named after [[The Football Association]] (The FA). Since 2015, it has been known as '''The Emirates FA Cup''' after its [[Emirates (airline)|headline sponsor]]. A concurrent [[women's association football|women's]] tournament is also held, the [[Women's FA Cup]].

The competition is open to all eligible [[football club (association football)|clubs]] down to Level 9 of the [[English football league system]] with Level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. Included in the competition are 20 professional clubs in the [[Premier League]] (level 1), 72 professional clubs in the [[English Football League]] (levels 2 to 4), and all clubs in steps 1–5 of the [[National League System]] (levels 5 to 9) as well as a tiny number of step 6 clubs acting as stand-ins for non-entries above.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Faulkner |first=Bryan |date=13 July 2022 |title=Rules of the FA Challenge Cup 2022-23 |url=https://www.thefa.com/-/media/thefacom-new/files/competitions/2022-23/emirates-fa-cup/rules-of-the-fa-challenge-cup-2022-23.ashx |journal=The Football Association |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A record 763 clubs competed in [[2011–12 FA Cup|2011–12]]. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by [[FA Cup semi-finals|the semi-finals]] and the [[FA Cup Final|final]]. Entrants are not [[seed (sports)|seeded]], although a system of [[Bye (sports)|byes]] based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds – the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.

The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from [[EFL League One|Leagues One]] and [[EFL League Two|Two]]. The last entrants are the Premier League and [[EFL Championship|Championship]] clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Since the formation of the Football League in 1888, the only non-League club to win the FA Cup is Tottenham Hotspur in 1901. Since 1914, when Queens Park Rangers reached the fourth round proper (the last eight/quarter-final stage), the only non-League club to have reached that stage is Lincoln City in 2017. Both Tottenham and QPR achieved their feats whilst members of the Southern Football League, which ran parallel to the Football League until 1920, when the Football League expanded and absorbed the top division of the Southern League. Since then, the Southern League became part of the English league pyramid, below the Football League.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely "giant-killing" victory.

Winners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League]] and a place in the upcoming [[FA Community Shield]]. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] are the most successful club with fourteen titles and [[Arsène Wenger]] is the most successful manager in the history of the competition, having won seven finals as Arsenal's manager.

[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] are the current holders, having beaten [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 6–5 on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] following a 0–0 draw in the [[2022 FA Cup Final|2022 final]].

[[File:FACupFinal1905NewcastleVilla.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Harry Hampton (footballer, born 1885)|Harry Hampton]] scores one of his two goals in the [[1905 FA Cup Final]], when [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] defeated [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]]]
In 1863, the newly founded [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (the FA) published the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] of Association Football, unifying the various different rules in use before then. On 20 July 1871, in the offices of [[The Sportsman (1865 newspaper)|''The Sportsman'' newspaper]], the FA Secretary [[C. W. Alcock]] proposed to the FA committee that "it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete". The [[1871–72 FA Cup|inaugural FA Cup tournament]] kicked off in November 1871. After thirteen games in all, [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] were crowned the winners in [[1872 FA Cup Final|the final]], on 16 March 1872. Wanderers retained the trophy the [[1872–73 FA Cup|following year]]. The modern cup was beginning to be established by the [[1888–89 FA Cup|1888–89 season]], when qualifying rounds were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collett |first=Mike |title=The Complete Record of The FA Cup |year=2003 |isbn=1-899807-19-5 |page=878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[1914–15 FA Cup|1914–15]] edition, the competition was suspended due to the [[World War I|First World War]], and did not resume until [[1919–20 FA Cup|1919–20]]. The [[1923 FA Cup Final]], commonly known as the "White Horse Final", was the first final to be played in the newly opened [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] (known at the time as the Empire Stadium). The [[1927 FA Cup Final|1927 final]] saw "[[Abide with Me]]" being sung for the first time at the Cup final, which has become a pre-match tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup final competition for fans|url=http://www.readingfc.co.uk/news/article/fa-cup-competition-songs-of-praise-fa-cup-choir-2227569.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129053100/http://www.readingfc.co.uk/news/article/fa-cup-competition-songs-of-praise-fa-cup-choir-2227569.aspx|archive-date=29 January 2015|publisher=Reading FC|access-date=6 April 2016|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], the competition was not played between the [[1938–39 FA Cup|1938–39]] and [[1945–46 FA Cup|1945–46]] editions. Due to the wartime breaks, the competition did not celebrate its centenary year until [[1980–81 FA Cup|1980–81]]; fittingly [[1981 FA Cup Final|the final]] featured a goal by [[Ricky Villa]] which was later voted the greatest goal ever scored in an FA Cup Final, but has since been replaced by [[Steven Gerrard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32628391|title=FA Cup final: The greatest goal from the last 50 years voted by you|work=BBC Sport|access-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having previously featured [[replay (sports)|replay]]s, the modern day practice of ensuring the [[FA Cup semi-finals|semi-final]] and final matches finish on the day was introduced in 2000. Redevelopment of Wembley saw the final played outside of England for the first time, the [[2001 FA Cup Final|2001]]–[[2006 FA Cup Final|2006]] finals being played at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]]. The final returned to Wembley in [[2007 FA Cup Final|2007]], followed by the semi-finals from 2008.

==Eligibility==
{{See also|Non-English football clubs in the FA Cup|List of Scottish football clubs in the FA Cup}}
An application window is open to clubs before entry lists, round byes and scheduling are announced in July. All clubs in the top four levels (the [[Premier League]] and the three divisions of the [[English Football League]]) are automatically eligible. Clubs from Level 5-9 ([[non-league football]]) are also eligible provided they play in either the [[FA Trophy]] or [[FA Vase]] competitions in the current season. All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition and [[The Football Association|The Association]] may reject applications at its discretion.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Previously, Level 10 clubs were a prominent feature in early qualifying rounds. The gradual remodelling of the [[National League System]] to a 'perfect' 1–2–4–8–16 system, with a first phase in 2018–19, a final phase in 2021–22 (which included the promotion of 107 clubs), and played to a full quota in 2022–23 has resulted in a larger number of teams playing in Level 7–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Promotion &amp; Relegation 2018-19 |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2018/jun/19/national-league-system-promotion-and-relegation-statement-190618 |access-date=18 August 2022 |website=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NLS allocation 2021-22 |url=https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/may/18/nls-allocations-20210518 |access-date=18 August 2022 |website=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NLS club allocation 2022-23 |url=https://www.thefa.com/news/2022/may/12/national-league-system-nls-club-allocations-2022-23-season-20221205 |website=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently for the FA Cup, entries equal the number in tiers 1–9 and is cut off to those below.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Though still able to apply, Level 10 clubs are used as alternates "subject to availability" in the event of a non/rejected applicant (with vacancies filled by Level 10 applicants with the best [[Points per game|PPG]] in the previous league season).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

The total number of entries in the FA Cup has changed as [[Non-League football]] has gradually been expanded and reorganised over time. In the [[2004–05 FA Cup|2004–05]] season, 660 clubs entered the competition, beating the long-standing record of 656 from the [[1921–22 FA Cup|1921–22 season]]. In [[2005–06 FA Cup|2005–06]] this increased to 674 entrants, in [[2006–07 FA Cup|2006–07]] to 687, in [[2007–08 FA Cup|2007–08]] to 731 clubs, in [[2008–09 FA Cup|2008–09]] and [[2009–10 FA Cup|2009–10]] to 762.&lt;ref name="record number of entries for 2008/9"&gt;{{cite web |title=Everyone's Up For The Cup |url=http://www.thefa.com/NewsAndFeatures |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150416164220/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2008/Jun/everyones_up_for_the_cup |archive-date=16 April 2015 |access-date=1 October 2020 |website=www.thefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of entries has also varied naturally from year-to-year as new clubs form and others dissolve at unequal rates. Though most leagues in the [[National League System]] maintain the same number of teams via reprieves, inevitably entry-level divisions (typically at tier 10) have to be impacted when a club leaves the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=National League System Regulations |url=https://www.thefa.com/-/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2022-23/individual-sections/23-national-league-system-regulations-v2.ashx |journal=The FA Handbook |publisher=The Football Association |issue=2022–23 |at=para. 5:5–5:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for example, 759 teams entered in [[2010–11 FA Cup|2010–11]], a record 763 in [[2011–12 FA Cup|2011–12]], 758 in [[2012–13 FA Cup|2012–13]], 737 in [[2013–14 FA Cup|2013–14]] and 736 in [[2014–15 FA Cup|2014–15]].&lt;ref name="record number of entries for 2008/9" /&gt; However, since 2021–22, The FA has cut off automatic eligibility to the 10th tier (to appear only subject to availability) and instead set the size of the draw to match the more stable number of teams in Level 1–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2 July 2021 |title=CLUB LINE-UP AND PRIZE FUND DETAILS FOR THE EMIRATES FA CUP 2021-22 SEASON REVEALED |url=https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/jul/02/20210702-emirates-fa-cup-and-fa-youth-cup-entries-exemptions-prize-fund-details-2021-22-season |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220425062013/https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/jul/02/20210702-emirates-fa-cup-and-fa-youth-cup-entries-exemptions-prize-fund-details-2021-22-season |archive-date=25 April 2022 |access-date= |website=thefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the competition may now see a standardised number of entries from one year to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=732 - FA plan to become the permanent number of entries each season |date=2 August 2022 |url=https://facupfactfile.wordpress.com/2022/08/02/fa-cup-2022-23-ep-rd-preview-by-numbers/ |access-date=18 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is currently 732 but could rise to 748 for 2023–24 with plans for a new [[South West Peninsula League|SWPL]] 9th tier division to share the [[South East England|South East]] with the existing [[Western Football League|Western League]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |date=22 July 2022 |title=PROJECT SOUTH WEST APPROVED BY FA LEAGUES COMMITTEE |url=https://www.swpleague.co.uk/blog-post/updates/ |access-date=18 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition, although it can happen in exceptional circumstances. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] did not defend their title in [[1999–2000 FA Cup|1999–2000]], as they were already in the [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship|inaugural]] [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Championship]]. The club stated that entering both tournaments would overload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their Champions League and Premier League titles. The club claimed that they did not want to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited United as they received a two-week break and won the [[1999–2000 Premier League|1999–2000 league title]] by an 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stage of the Club World Championship. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/853647.stm |title=Man Utd's FA Cup catastrophe |work=BBC News |date=27 July 2000 |access-date=1 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premiership/i-regret-manchester-uniteds-fa-cup-pullout-fergie-14583761.html |title=I regret Manchester United's FA Cup pull-out: Fergie |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=3 December 2009 |access-date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/united-underline-cup-withdrawal-742549.html |title=United underline Cup withdrawal |work=The Independent |last=Staniforth |first=Tommy |date=29 October 1999 |access-date=16 May 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible, although since the creation of the [[Welsh Premier League|League of Wales]] there are only five clubs remaining: [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (the only non-English team to win the tournament, in [[1926–27 FA Cup|1927]]), [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], and [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]]. In the early years other teams from Wales, Ireland and Scotland also took part in the competition, with Glasgow side [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] losing the final to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in [[1884 FA Cup Final|1884]] and [[1885 FA Cup Final|1885]] before being barred from entering by the [[Scottish Football Association]]. 

Entries from clubs affiliated to "offshore" associations are also eligible subject to consideration on an annual basis, with special provisions that may apply.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In the [[2013–14 FA Cup|2013–14 season]] the first [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] club entered the competition when [[Guernsey F.C.]] competed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/sport/2013/04/30/lions-in-fa-cup/ |title=Lions in FA Cup |publisher=Guernsey Press |date=30 April 2013 |website=www.thisisguernsy.com |access-date=3 May 2013 |archive-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015110114/http://www.thisisguernsey.com/sport/2013/04/30/lions-in-fa-cup/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game played in the Channel Islands – and thus the southernmost FA Cup tie played – took place on [[2021–22 FA Cup qualifying rounds#Extra preliminary round|7 August 2021]] between [[Jersey Bulls F.C.|Jersey Bulls]] and [[Horsham YMCA F.C.|Horsham YMCA]]. A third club, [[F.C.

==Competition format==

===Overview===
Beginning in August, the competition proceeds as a [[knockout tournament]] throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May. A system of byes ensures clubs above Level 9 enter the competition at later stages. There is no [[Seed (tennis)|seeding]], the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw. Prior to the fifth round, fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup Fifth-Round replays scrapped|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/18/fa-cup-fifth-round-replays-scrapped-this-season|website=www.theguarduan.com|access-date=18 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis. The next six rounds are the "proper" rounds where all clubs are in one draw.

===Schedule===
All entrants from Level 9 begin the competition in the Extra Preliminary Round, as well as any Level 10 team filling in for a vacancy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Teams from Level 8 are ranked on their PPG in the previous season, except newly promoted teams automatically ranked towards the bottom and newly relegated teams ranked to the top; teams are then split between entering at either the Extra-Preliminary or Preliminary Round so as to ensure the right balance of fixtures throughout the competition.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; From there, clubs from higher levels are added in later rounds, as per the table below. 

The months in which rounds are played are traditional, with exact dates subject to each calendar. The number of new entries, winners from previous rounds, and division of Level 8 teams in the two preliminary rounds are based on an entry list of 732 modelled on the [[English football league system|English league system]] as of 2022–23. From 2023–24, the entry list could rise to 746 in line with sixteen additional clubs at Level 9 meaning that the Extra Preliminary Round will have 444 teams with only 50 Level 8 clubs entering at the Preliminary Round.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The qualifying rounds are regionalised to reduce the travel costs for smaller non-league sides. The first and second proper rounds were also previously split into Northern and Southern sections, but this practice was ended after the [[1997–98 FA Cup|1997–98 competition]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The final is normally held the Saturday after the [[Premier League]] season finishes in May. The only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were: [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000]], when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment; [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11]] and [[2012–13 in English football|2012–13]] when the FA Cup Final was played before the Premier League season had finished, to allow [[Wembley Stadium]] to be ready for the [[UEFA Champions League]] final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/mar/06/fa-cup-final-manchester-derby |title=Tarnished FA Cup needs a Manchester derby's drama |work=The Guardian |date=6 March 2011 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12]] to allow [[England national football team|England]] time to prepare for that summer's [[UEFA Euro 2012|European Championships]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/12/2012-fa-cup-final-premier-league |title=No escape for 2012 FA Cup final from date clash with Premier League |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2011 |location=London |first=Owen |last=Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2019–20 in English football|2019–20]] when the final was delayed until August due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/29/fa-cup-final-to-be-held-on-1-august-with-quarter-finals-resuming-on-27-june-football |title=FA Cup final to be held on 1 August with quarter-finals resuming on 27 June |work=The Guardian |date=29 May 2020 |access-date=17 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/52726943 |title=Watch: 2006 FA Cup Final Rewind – Liverpool win FA Cup on penalties |website=BBC Sport |quote=Today should have been FA Cup final day |date=23 May 2020 |access-date=9 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Draws===
The draws for the Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, and First Qualifying Rounds used to all occur at the same time. Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance.

The draw for each of the proper rounds is broadcast live on television, usually taking place at the conclusion of live coverage of one of the games of the previous round. Public interest is particularly high during the draw for the third round, which is where the top-ranked teams are added to the draw.

===Tiebreaking===
In rounds up to and including the Fourth Round Proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) go to a [[replay (sports)|replay]], played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]], and if still necessary, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Since [[2016–17 FA Cup|2016–17]], ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties. From [[2018–19 FA Cup|2018–19]], Fifth Round ties are also settled by extra time and penalties.

Until [[1990–91 FA Cup|1990–91]], further replays would be played until one team was victorious. In [[1971–72 FA Cup|1971–72]], a [[1971–72 FA Cup qualifying rounds#Fourth qualifying round|fourth qualifying round]] game between [[Alvechurch F.C.|Alvechurch]] and [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] was played six times until Alvechurch won in the fifth replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allner |first=Graham |date=21 November 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/21/oxford-city-alvechurch-longest-fa-cup |title=22 November 1971: The longest-ever FA Cup tie finally finishes |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |access-date=4 May 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their [[1974–75 FA Cup|1975 campaign]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] played 12 games over six rounds, which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1975WestHamFulham.aspx |access-date=5 March 2005 |title=Hammers nail Fulham |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 January 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105040811/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1975WestHamFulham.aspx |publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game, but from [[1991–92 FA Cup|1991–92]] they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice for the rounds proper. This led to [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]] being introduced, the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] eliminated [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penalty shoot-out makes English FA Cup history|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=12JPAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6114%2C5540359|newspaper=New Straits Press|location=Kuala Lumpur|page=44|date=28 November 1991|access-date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[1980–81 FA Cup|1980–81]] to [[1998–99 FA Cup|1998–99]], the semi-finals went to extra time on the day if the score after 90 minutes was a draw. If the score was still level after extra time, the match would go to a replay. Replays for the semi-finals were scrapped for [[1999–2000 FA Cup|1999–2000]], the last semi-final to go into a replay being in 1998–99 when Manchester United beat [[Arsenal F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry|rivals]] Arsenal 2–1 after extra time. The first game had ended in a 0–0 draw.

The first [[FA Cup Final]] to go to extra time and a replay was the [[1875 FA Cup Final|1875 final]], between the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] and the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]]. The initial tie finished 1–1 but the Royal Engineers won the replay 2–0 in normal time. The last replayed final was the [[1993 FA Cup Final]], when Arsenal and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] fought a 1–1 draw. The replay saw Arsenal win the FA Cup, 2–1 after extra time.

The last quarter-final to go to a replay was Manchester United vs [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the [[2015–16 FA Cup]]. The original game at Old Trafford ended in a 1–1 draw, while Manchester United won the replay at the [[Boleyn Ground]], 2–1. It was also the last FA Cup game ever played at the Boleyn Ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10295478/fa-cup-quarter-final-replays-to-be-scrapped-from-next-season|title=FA Cup quarter-final replays to be scrapped from next season|first=Mark|last=Ashenden|work=Sky Sports|publisher=Sky UK|date=26 May 2016|access-date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last fifth round replay saw [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] defeat [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] 6–1 at Wembley in the [[2017–18 FA Cup]] after the first match at [[Spotland Stadium]] ended in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46607201|title=FA Cup fifth-round replays abolished to ease fixture congestion|work=BBC Sport|date=18 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification for subsequent competitions==

===European football===
The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's [[UEFA Europa League]] (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in [[1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960]] until [[1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1998]], they entered the now-defunct [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] instead). This European place applies even if the team is [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] or is not in the English top flight. In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup instead). FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage. Losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage.&lt;ref name="BBCUP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/fans/faqs/who-qualifies-to-play-in-europe/ |title=Who qualifies to play in Europe? |access-date=24 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907140644/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/fans/faqs/who-qualifies-to-play-in-europe/ |archive-date=7 September 2012 |df=dmy }} Premier League, 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League]] season, however, [[UEFA]] does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA Direct |url=http://www.uefa.org/MultimediaFiles/Download/EuroExperience/uefaorg/Publications/02/01/17/30/2011730_DOWNLOAD.pdf |publisher=UEFA Magazine |access-date=27 October 2013 |date=October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the winner — and until 2015, the runner-up —
has already qualified for Europe through their league position (with the exception of the UEFA Cup until 1998), the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest-place team in the league who has not yet qualified.

===FA Community Shield===
The FA Cup winners also qualify for the following season's single-match [[FA Community Shield]], the traditional season opener played against the previous season's [[Premier League]] champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league – the [[double (association football)#England|double]]).

==Venues==
[[File:Wembley-STadion 2013.JPG|thumb|Since 2007 the [[FA Cup Final]] has been held at [[Wembley Stadium]], on the site of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|the previous stadium]] which hosted it from 1923 to 2000.]]
Fixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams. The [[FA Cup semi-finals|semi-finals]] and [[FA Cup Final|final]] are played at a neutral venue – the rebuilt [[Wembley Stadium]].

===Competition rounds===
In the matches for the 12 competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn – simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. However, since [[2003–04 FA Cup|2003]], clubs cannot move grounds to the away side's for capacity or financial reasons. If any move has to be made, it has to be to a neutral venue and any additional monies earned by the move goes into the central pot.&lt;ref&gt;Burnton, Simon (11 March 2003). [https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/mar/12/newsstory.sport1 "FA Slam Door on Cup's Rogue Venue-Switchers."] ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 29 July 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of a [[draw (tie)|draw]], the [[replay (sports)|replay]] is played at the ground of the team who originally played [[home advantage|away from home]].

In the days when multiple replays were possible, the second replay (and any further replays) were played at neutral grounds. The clubs involved could alternatively agree to toss for home advantage in the second replay.

===Semi-finals===
{{Main|FA Cup semi-finals}}
The semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt [[Wembley Stadium]] since [[2007–08 FA Cup|2008]], one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007). For the first decade of the competition, the [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] was used as the semi-final venue. In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel. The top three most used venues in this period were [[Villa Park]] in Birmingham (55 times), [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in Sheffield (34 times) and [[Old Trafford]] in Manchester (23 times). The [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]] was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring [[Football in London|London teams]]. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.

In 2003 the FA took the decision to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=FA Cup: Greg Dyke says semi-finals will stay at Wembley|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27008308|access-date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was controversial, with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London, as well as taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/news/news0002-facup.html |title=Football supporters hail FA Cup semi-final decision |publisher=Football Supporters' Federation |access-date=8 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208165141/http://www.fsf.org.uk/news/news0002-facup.html |archive-date=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup semi-finals: should they be played at Wembley? – poll|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/poll/2013/apr/11/fa-cup-semi-finals-wembley-poll|website=The Guardian|date=11 April 2013|access-date=12 February 2016|first=Paul|last=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fan poll by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 found 86% opposition to Wembley semi-finals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The final has been played at the rebuilt [[Wembley Stadium]] since it opened, in [[2006–07 FA Cup|2007.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6039052.stm |title=Wembley Stadium to open next year |work=BBC News |access-date=17 March 2007 |date=19 October 2006 |first=Howard |last=Nurse }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]] in Wales. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]] since it opened in [[1922–23 FA Cup|1923]] (being originally named the Empire Stadium). One exception to this 78 year series of Empire Stadium finals (including five replays) was the [[1970 FA Cup Final|1970 replay]] between [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], held at [[Old Trafford]] in Manchester.

In the 51 years prior to the Empire Stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in London, and mainly at the [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] and then [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#FA Cup Finals (1895–1914)|Crystal Palace]]. It was played 22 times at The Oval (the inaugural competition in 1872, and then all but two times until [[1892 FA Cup Final|1892]]). After The Oval, Crystal Palace hosted 21 finals from [[1895 FA Cup Final|1895]] to [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], broken up by four replays elsewhere. The other London venues were [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] from [[1920 FA Cup Final|1920]] to [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]] (the last three finals before the move to Empire Stadium); and the University of Oxford's [[Lillie Bridge Grounds|Lillie Bridge]] in [[Fulham]] for the second ever final, in [[1873 FA Cup Final|1873]]. The other venues used sparingly in this period were all outside of London, as follows:
* [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|Racecourse Ground]], Derby ([[1886 FA Cup Final|1886]])
* [[Fallowfield Stadium]], Manchester ([[1893 FA Cup Final|1893]])
* [[Goodison Park]], Liverpool ([[1894 FA Cup Final|1894]])
* [[Burnden Park]], [[Bolton]] ([[1901 FA Cup Final|1901]] replay)
* Goodison Park ([[1910 FA Cup Final|1910]] replay)
* [[Old Trafford]], Manchester ([[1911 FA Cup Final|1911]] replay)
* [[Bramall Lane]], Sheffield ([[1912 FA Cup Final|1912]] replay)
* Old Trafford ([[1915 FA Cup Final|1915]])

===Artificial turf===
The FA permitted [[artificial turf]] (3G) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the [[2014–15 FA Cup|2014–15 edition]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=3G pitches allowed in all rounds of FA Cup from 2014–15|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26717348|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 2015–16 rules, the pitch must be of FIFA One Star quality, or Two Star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; This followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only – if a team with a 3G pitch progressed to the competition proper, they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible entrant with a natural grass pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Artificial pitches given go-ahead for FA Cup qualifying rounds|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18833248|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been strong proponents of the surface, the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3G surface was a televised first round replay at [[Maidstone United F.C.|Maidstone United]]'s [[Gallagher Stadium]] on 20 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Maidstone United 2–1 Stevenage|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29999662|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trophy==
[[File:The King George V presents the FA Cup 1914.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|King [[George V]] presents the FA Cup trophy to [[Tommy Boyle (footballer, born 1886)|Tommy Boyle]] of [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], April 1914]]
The eventual winners of the competition receive the FA Cup. It is only loaned to the club by the FA; under the current (2015–16) rules it must be returned by 1 March, or earlier if given seven days' notice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Traditionally, the holders had the Cup until the following year's presentation, although more recently the trophy has been taken on publicity tours by the FA in between finals.&lt;ref name="recast"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27405196|title=FA Cup reborn for 2014 final as new trophy is cast|work=BBC News|access-date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trophy comes in three parts – the cup itself, plus a lid and a base. There have been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have been presented. The original trophy, known as the "little tin idol", was 18 inches high and made by Martin, Hall &amp; Co. It was stolen in 1895 and never recovered, and so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910. The FA decided to change the design after the [[1908–09 FA Cup|1909 winners]], Manchester United, made their own replica, leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35909762|title=FA Cup given top Antiques Roadshow value of more than £1m|work=BBC News|access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new, larger design was by [[Fattorini and Sons]], and was used from 1911.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In order to preserve this original, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had to be replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in 2014, was built heavier to withstand the increased handling.&lt;ref name="recast"/&gt; Of the four surviving trophies, only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4568251.stm|title=Birmingham City boss buys FA Cup|date=21 May 2005|work=BBC News|access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished, in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony.&lt;ref name="recast"/&gt; This means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take 20 under normal conditions, although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match, and sketching the presumed winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/13/obsmagspecial5.theobserver5|title=Emmet Smith – FA Cup engraver|date=12 May 2007|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final, the trophy is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists, with the loser's ribbons being removed at the end of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surreyfa.com/news/2012/jul/up-for-the-cup-historic-fa-cup-on-display-at-stoke-park|title=Up for the Cup!

At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch.

The tradition of presenting the trophy immediately after the game did not start until the [[1882 FA Cup Final|1882 final]]; after the first final in 1872 the trophy was not presented to the winners, Wanderers, until a reception held four weeks later in the Pall Mall Restaurant in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grXiAUEzVZoC|title=Firsts, Lasts &amp; Onlys of Football: Presenting the most amazing football facts from the last 160 years|last=Donnelley|first=Paul|date=4 October 2010|publisher=Octopus|isbn=9780600622543|page=1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the original rules, the trophy was to be permanently presented to any club which won the competition three times, although when inaugural winners Wanderers achieved this feat by the [[1876 FA Cup Final|1876 final]], the rules were changed by FA Secretary CW Alcock (who was also captain of Wanderers in their first victory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcfKAQAAQBAJ|title=The Victorian Football Miscellany|last=Brown|first=Paul|date=29 May 2013|publisher=Superelastic|isbn=9780956227058|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] have the distinction of being the football club which has held the FA Cup trophy for the longest uninterrupted period - seven years. Portsmouth had defeated [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 4–1 in the [[1939 FA Cup Final]] and were awarded the trophy as 1938–39 FA Cup winners. But with the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the regular [[1939–40 Football League|Football League]] and [[1939–40 FA Cup|FA Cup]] competitions for the [[1939–40 in English football|1939–40 season]] were cancelled for the duration of the war. Portsmouth's manager [[Jack Tinn]] was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' throughout the duration of the war, but this is an [[urban myth]]. Because the naval city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for [[The Blitz|German Luftwaffe bombing]], the FA Cup trophy was actually taken ten miles to the north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of [[Lovedean]], and there it resided in a quaint thatched roof country pub called ''The Bird in Hand'' for the seven years of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk/?BIHrequestID=4C55838218D9D39854D199BD64BA29|title=LoveDeanBirdInHand|website=lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conclusion of World War II, the FA Cup trophy was presented back to the Football Association by the club in time for the [[1946 FA Cup Final]].

===Original design from 1871===

====1871 original====
The first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall &amp; Co at a cost of £20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/thetrophies|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140625213452/http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/thetrophies|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2014|title=The Trophies|publisher=The Football Association|access-date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was stolen from a [[Birmingham]] shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again. Despite a £10 reward for information, the crime was never solved. As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa £25 to pay for a replacement.

Just over 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal Henry (Harry) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the story being published in the ''[[Sunday Pictorial]]'' newspaper on 23 February 1958. He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men, although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' newspaper (the crime pre-dated written police reports) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen, detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed. Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit [[Half crown (British coin)|half-crown]] coins, which matched known intelligence of the time, in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through [[betting shops]] at a local racecourse, although Burge had no history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison. He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars. Released in 1961, he died in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unsolved: Did this OAP really steal the famous FA Cup? |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/unsolved-did-this-oap-really-steal-the-famous-124794 |work=Birmingham Mail |publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands |date=13 May 2010 |access-date=4 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1895 replica====
[[File:1896 FA Cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The second FA Cup trophy, used between 1896 and 1910]]
After the theft, a replica of the trophy was made, which was used until a redesign of the trophy in 1911. The 1895 replica was then presented to the FA's long-serving president [[Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, 11th Lord Kinnaird|Lord Kinnaird]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|date=20 April 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4925362.stm|title=Oldest FA Cup presented to museum |newspaper=BBC|access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold at [[Christie's]] auction house on 19 May 2005 for [[Pound sterling|£]]420,000 (£478,400 including auction fees and taxes).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football [[Souvenir|memorabilia]], surpassing the £254,000 paid for the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The successful bidder was [[David Gold (businessman)|David Gold]], the then joint chairman of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the [[National Football Museum]] in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]], after they beat [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] 7–1 in a charity replay of the [[1872 FA Cup Final|first FA Cup final]].

The redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5&amp;nbsp;cm (24.2 inches) high, and was designed and manufactured by [[Messers Fattorini and Sons|Fattorini &amp; Sons]] of Bradford, coincidentally being won by [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in its first outing.&lt;ref name="recast"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On the 27 March 2016 episode of the BBC television programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', this trophy was valued at £1&amp;nbsp;million by expert [[Alastair Dickenson]], although he suggested that, due to the design featuring depictions of grapes and vines, it may not have been specifically produced for the FA, but was instead an off-the-shelf design originally meant to be a wine or champagne cooler.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was later disproved when Thomas Fattorini was invited to the Antiques Roadshow to "ambush" Alastair Dickenson with the competition winning design by Fattorini &amp; Sons. The show was filmed at [[Baddesley Clinton]] and subsequentially aired on 23 October 2016.

A smaller, but otherwise identical, replica was also made by the company [[Thomas Fattorini Ltd|Thomas Fattorini]], the North Wales Coast FA Cup trophy, and is contested annually by members of that regional Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=H.R.|title=North Wales Coast Football League history|url=https://www.welshsoccerarchive.co.uk/history.php?league_id=22|website=Welsh Soccer Archive|access-date=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105011623/https://www.welshsoccerarchive.co.uk/history.php?league_id=22|archive-date=5 January 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014 replica====
The 2014 replica was made by [[Thomas Lyte]], handcrafted in sterling 925 silver over 250 hours. A weight increase for greater durability has taken it to {{convert|6.3|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="recast"/&gt;

==Medals==
Each club in the final receives 40 winners' or runners'-up medals to be distributed among players, staff and officials. The traditional styles of gold cased medals--the winners' medal, which had remained largely unchanged since the 1890s, and runners-up medals, which were last updated in 1946--were replaced for the 2021 Final by new designs of gold winners' medals and silver runners-up medals suspended on a ribbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/-/media/thefacom-new/files/competitions/2017-18/fa-cup/fa-cup-rules-2017-2018.ashx|title=RULES OF THE FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION|publisher=The Football Association|page=25|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|English football sponsorship}}
Since the start of the [[1994–95 FA Cup|1994–95 season]], the FA Cup has been sponsored. However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name. Sponsorship deals run for four years, though – as in the case of [[E.ON]] – one-year extensions may be agreed. [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates Airline]] has been the sponsor since 2015, initially renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and 'The FA Cup with [[Budweiser]]'.&lt;ref name="Emirates"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32944162 |title=FA Cup get first title sponsor following deal with Emirates Airline |work=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2015 |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emirates sponsorship deal, originally scheduled to terminate in 2018, was later extended until 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/the-emirates-fa-cup-sponsorship-extended-until-2021/|title=The Emirates FA Cup sponsorship extended until 2021|website=The Emirates FA Cup sponsorship extended until 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cup runs and giant killings==
The possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a "giant killing", is much anticipated by the public. Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The harder they fall|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/facupstories/sport/story/124299.html|website=ESPN.co.uk|access-date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every club in the [[English football league system|League Pyramid]] has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history.&lt;ref name="times analysis" /&gt; It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top [[Premier League]] team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e. from outside [[The Football League]].

One analysis of four years of FA Cup results showed that it was 99.85 per cent likely that at least one team would beat one from its next higher division in a given year. The probability drops to 48.8 per cent for a two-division gap, and 39.28 per cent for a three-division gap.&lt;ref name="times analysis"&gt;{{cite news|title=Giant-killing not a tall order in FA Cup|url=https://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7973-1430225,00.html|work=[[The Times]]|date=8 January 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105024420/https://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C7973-1430225%2C00.html|archive-date=5 January 2006|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
[[The Football League]] was founded in 1888, 16 years after the first FA Cup competition. Before its establishment as the dominant football competition in England, teams from rival leagues did make the final of the FA Cup. The Wednesday (later Sheffield Wednesday) in 1890 reached the final as a member of the [[Football Alliance]], two years before that competition merged with the Football League. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=W |first1=Paul |title=The Football Alliance: Teams Who Didn't Make the League |date=4 April 2020 |url=https://the1888letter.com/the-football-alliance-teams-who-didnt-make-the-league/ |publisher=The 1888 Letter |access-date=14 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, with the Football League predominantly in [[Northern England|the North]] and [[Midlands]] of England, leading clubs of the [[Southern Football League]] were of a level with Football League teams, and in 1901 Southern League members [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] became the only non-League side to win the Cup, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Medhurst |first1=James |title=Southern League Division 1, 1900–01 |url=https://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/23-Season-in-brief/1650-southern-league-division-1-1900-01 |publisher=When Saturday Comes |access-date=14 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; while fellow Southern League team [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] were losing finalists in 1900 and 1902. In [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21]], the Football League [[Football League Third Division|expanded]] to incorporate teams from the Southern League's first division, and the following year it added a [[Football League Third Division North|further division]] consisting of leading northern and midlands clubs. This consolidated the Football League's position as the leading competition in English football, and established the hierarchy in which non-League clubs in the [[English football league system]] competing in the FA Cup would face Football League teams as clear [[underdogs]].

===Non-League giant killings===
Since the expansion of the Football League in 1921, the best performance of a team from outside the Football League was [[National League (division)|National League]] side [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]'s run to the quarter-finals of the [[2016–17 FA Cup]], during which they [[Burnley 0–1 Lincoln City (2017)|defeated]] Premier League side [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], the most recent victory for a non-league team over a top-flight side. Such victories are rare; there have been only three since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21095990 BBC Sport], 26 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Giant-killings can also be applied where the defeated team is from lower down the Football League, particularly where the defeated club is very notable or the winning team particularly obscure. [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], having already won five league titles in their history, were in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1958–59 Football League#Second Division|1959]] when they [[1958–59 FA Cup|lost 2–1]] to [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]] of the [[1958–59 Southern Football League|Southern League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Dan |title=FA Cup archive: Liverpool lose to Worcester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/35174937 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known non-league giant-killing came in the [[1971–72 FA Cup]], when non-league [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] defeated First Division [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/28/newsstory.hereford |title=It'll never happen |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=28 January 2007 |access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hereford were trailing 1–0 with less than seven minutes left in the [[1971–72 FA Cup#Third Round Proper|Third Round Proper replay]], when Hereford's [[Ronnie Radford]] scored the equaliser – a goal still shown regularly when FA Cup fixtures are broadcast. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dirs |first1=Ben |title=Ronnie Radford: The FA Cup goal that made time stand still |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30521200 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=16 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hereford finished the shocking comeback by defeating Newcastle 2–1 in the match. They finished that season as runners-up of the [[1971–72 Southern Football League|Southern League]], behind [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], and were [[re-election (Football League)|voted into the Football League]] at the expense of [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]]. 

Some small clubs gain a reputation for being "cup specialists" after two or more giant killing feats within a few years.&lt;ref name="times analysis" /&gt; [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] hold the record for the most victories over league opposition as a non-league team, having recorded 20 wins through the years before they achieved [[Promotion and relegation#English example|promotion]] into The Football League in [[2002–03 Football Conference|2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/12/FACup_TwentyToTackleAnswers.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20081123025353/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/12/FACup_TwentyToTackleAnswers.htm|url-status=dead|title=TheFA.com – Twenty to tackle answers|date=23 November 2008|archive-date=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record for a club which has never entered the Football League is held by [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]], with 17 wins against league teams.

===Non-League cup runs===
{{see also|List of non-League clubs in the Fifth Round of the FA Cup since 1945}}
For non-League teams, reaching the Third Round Proper – where all Level 1 sides now enter – is considered a major achievement. In the [[2008–09 FA Cup]], a record eight non-League teams achieved this feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/03/fa-cup-third-round-non-league |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Non-league presence in third round of FA Cup breaks all-time record |first=Anna |last=Kessel |date=3 January 2009 |access-date=2 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2021–22 season, only ten non-League teams have [[list of non-League clubs in the Fifth Round of the FA Cup since 1945|reached the Fifth Round Proper]] (final 16) since 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/sports_talk/1060082.stm |work=BBC News |title=Ask Albert – Number 8 |date=7 December 2000 |access-date=2 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and only [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] have progressed to the Sixth Round (final 8), during the 2016–17 edition of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38940052 |work=BBC News |title=Burnley 0 – 1 Lincoln City |date=18 February 2017 |access-date=18 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chasetown F.C.|Chasetown]], while playing at [[English football league system#The system|Level 8]] of English football during the [[2007–08 FA Cup|2007–08 competition]], were the lowest-ranked team to ever play in the Third Round Proper (final 64, of 731 teams entered that season). Chasetown was then a member of the [[2007–08 Southern Football League|Southern League Division One Midlands]] (a lower level within the [[Southern Football League]]), when they lost to [[Football League Championship]] (Level 2) team [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], the eventual FA Cup runners-up that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7163953.stm Chasetown 1–3 Cardiff].&lt;/ref&gt; Their success earned the lowly organisation over £60,000 in prize money. [[Marine F.C.|Marine]] matched this in the [[2020–21 FA Cup|2020–21 competition]] as a member of the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One North West, and were drawn against [[Premier League]] (Level 1) team [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], whom they lost to 5–0.

===Giant killings between League clubs===
Giant-killings can apply to matches between league clubs, particularly where teams from tier 4 have defeated tier 1 sides. In games between League sides, one of the most notable results was the [[Wrexham A.F.C. 2–1 Arsenal F.C.|1992 victory]] by [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], [[1990–91 Football League Fourth Division|bottom]] of the previous season's League (avoiding relegation due to expansion of [[English Football League|The Football League]]), over [[1990–91 Football League#First Division|reigning]] champions Arsenal. Another similar shock was when [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 2–1 in [[2002–03 FA Cup|2003]]. Everton finished seventh in the [[2002–03 Premier League|Premier League]] and Shrewsbury Town were [[2002–03 Football League#Third Division|relegated]] to the [[2003–04 Football Conference|Football Conference]] that [[2002–03 in English football|same season]].

===Results by team===
Since its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 44 different teams. Teams shown in ''italics'' are no longer in existence. Additionally, [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a [[Scottish Football Association]] ruling in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ask Albert – Number 5 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/1179349.stm |work=BBC Sport |access-date=26 April 2010 |date=19 February 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{notelist-ua}}

===Consecutive winners===
Four clubs have won consecutive FA Cups on more than one occasion: [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] ([[2002 FA Cup Final|2002]], [[2003 FA Cup Final|2003]] and [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]], [[2015 FA Cup Final|2015]]).

===Winning managers===
{{See also|List of FA Cup winning managers}}
The record for most titles for a manager is held by [[Arsène Wenger]], who won the FA Cup with Arsenal seven times ([[1998 FA Cup Final|1998]], [[2002 FA Cup Final|2002]], [[2003 FA Cup Final|2003]], [[2005 FA Cup Final|2005]], [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]], [[2015 FA Cup Final|2015]], [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]]). Wenger is also the only manager to have won the Cup at the old Wembley Stadium, the Millennium Stadium, and the new Wembley Stadium.

===Doubles/Trebles===
[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] ([[1998–99 in English football|1999]]) are the only English team to have won [[Treble (association football)|the treble]] in the traditional definition, commonly referred to as the continental treble, winning [[1998–99 FA Premier League|league]], [[1998–99 FA Cup|cup]], and [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]]. They are to date one of only eight European sides to do so. [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] (2019) are the only club to have achieved a domestic [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of league, FA Cup and [[EFL Cup]], having beaten [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 4–3 on penalties in the [[2019 EFL Cup Final|EFL Cup Final]], finished at the top of the [[2018–19 Premier League|Premier League]], and beaten [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] 6–0 in the FA Cup Final. Note that the domestic treble is often regarded as separate to the treble as many European sides do not have a [[league cup]] competition equivalent. Liverpool ([[2000–01 in English football|2001]]) won the FA Cup, [[2000–01 Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[2000–01 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] to complete a [[Treble (association football)#Other trebles|cup treble]].

Eight clubs have won the FA Cup as part of a [[Double (association football)|League and Cup double]], namely [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] (1889), [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (1897), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1961), [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (1971, 1998, 2002), [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (1986), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (1994, 1996, 1999),[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] (2010) and [[Manchester City F.C]](2019). In 1993, Arsenal became the first side to win both the FA Cup and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in the same season when they beat [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] 2–1 in both finals. Liverpool (2001, 2022), Chelsea (in 2007) and Manchester City (2019) have since repeated this feat. In 2012, Chelsea accomplished a different cup double consisting of the FA Cup and the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|2012]] [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].

===Outside England===
The FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once. [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley. They had previously made it to the final only to lose to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1925 and lost another final to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in 2008. Cardiff City is also the only team to win the national cups of two different countries in the same season, having also won the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1927. The Scottish team [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885.

===Outside the top division===
Since the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] ([[1894 FA Cup Final|1894]]); [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] ([[1901 FA Cup Final|1901]]); [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] ([[1908 FA Cup Final|1908]]); [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] ([[1912 FA Cup Final|1912]]); [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] ([[1931 FA Cup Final|1931]]); [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] ([[1973 FA Cup Final|1973]]), [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] ([[1976 FA Cup Final|1976]]) and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] ([[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]]). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) – Tottenham were playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation. Other than Tottenham's victory, only [[#Winners and finalists|24 finalists]] have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton ([[1902 FA Cup Final|1902]], then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers.

Sunderland's win in 1973 was considered a major upset, having beaten [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] who finished third in [[1972–73 Football League#First Division|the top flight]] that season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/History/Postings/2003/11/46982.htm |title=TheFA.com – Shocks do happen |publisher=The Football Association |access-date=6 April 2005 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20050305044037/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/History/Postings/2003/11/46982.htm |archive-date=5 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; as was West Ham's victory over Arsenal in 1980 as the Gunners were in their third successive FA Cup Final and were also the cup holders from the previous year as well as just having finished [[1979–80 Football League|4th in the First Division]], whereas West Ham had ended the season 7th in Division 2. This also marked the last time (as of 2021–22) a team from outside the top division won the FA Cup. Uniquely, in [[2007–08 FA Cup|2008]] three of the four semi-finalists (Barnsley, [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and West Bromwich) were from outside the top division, although the eventual winner was the last remaining top-flight team, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7286364.stm |title=FA Cup semi-final draw 2008 |work=BBC Sport |access-date=15 March 2012 |date=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Bromwich (1931) are the only team to have won the FA Cup and earned promotion to the top flight in the same season; whereas [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] ([[2013 FA Cup Final|2013]]) are the only team to have won the Cup and been relegated from the top flight in the same season.

The FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the [[Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events]].

In the early years of coverage the BBC had exclusive radio coverage with a picture of the pitch marked in the ''[[Radio Times]]'' with numbered squares to help the listener follow the match on the radio. The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in [[1926 FA Cup Final|1926]] between [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester, the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff City in 1927. The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full. The following season's final between Preston and [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] was covered in full by the BBC. When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television, during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. which was six hours before kick off. The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988, when ITV lost coverage to the BBC.

From 1988 to 1997, the BBC was the exclusive broadcaster of the competition on terrestrial television and covered the competition from the third round onwards, showing one live match per round alongside highlights. In 1990, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] (BSB) obtained rights to the competition, and showed a live match from rounds 1 and 2. This continued to be the case after [[Sky Television (1984–1990)|Sky]] took over BSB in 1991.

From 1997 to 2001, ITV and Sky shared live coverage with both having two matches per round and BBC continuing with highlights on ''[[Match of the Day]]''. From 2002 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. From [[2008–09 FA Cup|2008–09]] to [[2013–14 FA Cup|2013–14]], FA Cup matches are shown live by [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] across England and [[Wales]], with [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] broadcasting to [[Northern Ireland]] but STV refusing to show them. ITV shows 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final is also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, [[Setanta Sports]] showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches exclusively to [[Scotland]], after the ITV franchise holder in Scotland, [[STV (TV network)|STV]], decided not to broadcast FA Cup games. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and [[England national football team|England internationals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FA face Setanta shortfall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8115805.stm |website=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 June 2009 |access-date=12 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009–10 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. ESPN bought the competition for the 2010–11 to 2012–13 season and during this time [[Rebecca Lowe]] became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.

In October 2009, The FA announced that ITV would show an additional match in the First and Second Rounds on ITV, with one replay match shown on [[ITV4]]. One match and one replay match from the first two rounds will broadcast on The FA website for free, in a similar situation to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup Qualifier]] between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2009/FACup_TVTies_1P.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.today/20091027202428/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2009/FACup_TVTies_1P.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 October 2009 |title=FA Cup to be broadcast Free-to-Air |access-date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009–10 First Round match between [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and Leeds United was the first FA Cup match to be streamed online live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/10/oldham-athletic-news/31689/latics-to-face-leeds-in-cup |title=Latics to face Leeds in Cup |access-date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many{{Who|date=June 2011}} expected [[BSkyB]] to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009–10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final. [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]] took over the package Setanta held for the FA Cup from the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/07/fa-cup-espn-bbc-itv |title=ESPN secures rights to show FA Cup matches from next season |date=7 December 2009 |work=The Guardian |access-date=30 December 2009 |location=London |first=Owen |last=Gibson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 final was also shown live on [[Sky 3D]] in addition to ESPN (who provided the 3D coverage for Sky 3D) and ITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2011/ESPN_3D_Coverage.htm |title=ESPN's 3D coverage of 2011 FA Cup Final to be available on Sky 3D |work=Sky TV |access-date=26 April 2011 |location=London |archive-date=2 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502064642/http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2011/ESPN_3D_Coverage.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sale of ESPN's UK and Ireland channels to [[BT Group|BT]], ESPN's rights package transferred to [[BT Sport]] from the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.btplc.com/News/Articles/Showarticle.cfm?ArticleID=022AEA86-B466-4C6E-9A3F-0BE241ED630B |title=BT Group acquires ESPN's UK and Ireland television channels business |publisher=BT Group |date=25 February 2013 |access-date=25 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301073342/http://www.btplc.com/News/Articles/Showarticle.cfm?ArticleID=022AEA86-B466-4C6E-9A3F-0BE241ED630B |archive-date=1 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and [[Talksport]] provides radio coverage including several full live commentaries per round, with additional commentaries broadcast on [[BBC Local Radio]].

Until the 2008–09 season, the [[BBC]] and [[Sky Sports]] shared television coverage, with the BBC showing three matches in the earlier rounds. Some analysts argued the decision to move away from the Sky and, in particular, the BBC undermined the FA Cup in the eyes of the public.

The early rounds of the 2008–09 competition were covered for the first time by ITV's online service, [[ITV Local]]. The [[2008–09 FA Cup qualifying rounds#Extra preliminary round|first match]] of the competition, between [[Wantage Town F.C.|Wantage Town]] and [[Brading Town F.C.|Brading Town]], was broadcast live online. Highlights of eight games of each round were broadcast as catch up on ITV Local.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/FA_Cup_online.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20081123062714/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/FA_Cup_online.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 November 2008 |title=Watch The FA Cup online }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2008/07/Watch_live_online.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080818225653/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2008/07/Watch_live_online.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 August 2008 |title=Cup tie live online }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since ITV Local closed, this coverage did not continue.

ITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the [[2014–15 FA Cup]], terrestrial rights returned to [[BBC Sport]], with the final being shown on [[BBC One]] while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights. Under this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and still having the first pick for each round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=BBC to show live matches from 2014–15 season |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23339424 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 July 2013 |access-date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matches involving Welsh clubs are sometimes exclusively broadcast on [[Welsh language]] channel [[S4C]], which is also available to view across the rest of the United Kingdom on satellite and cable television, and through the channel's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=S4C to broadcast live coverage of Wrexham's FA Cup clash |url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=575 |website=S4C |publisher=Sianel Pedwar Cymru |date=2 November 2011 |access-date=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar arrangement is shared with [[BBC Cymru Wales]] from 2014 to 2015, potentially giving the BBC an extra match per round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wrexham v Stevenage or Maidstone live on BBC Wales |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30043743 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=13 November 2014 |access-date=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2019, it was announced that ITV would replace [[BT Sport]] in broadcasting the FA Cup from the 2021–22 season, this new deal will see [[BBC]] and ITV become joint broadcasters of the tournament for the first time since 1990, this will mean for the first time that all FA Cup matches would all be exclusively broadcast on [[free-to-air]] television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=FA Cup to be free-to-air from 2021|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48388980|access-date=24 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Coaches' Trophy''' (officially known as the '''AFCA National Championship Trophy''' and popularly as '''"the crystal football"''') is the [[trophy]] awarded annually by the [[American Football Coaches Association]] (AFCA) to the [[NCAA Division I FBS]] [[college football]] [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] as determined by the [[Coaches Poll]]. The trophy has been presented since 1986 and was contractually given to the winner of the [[BCS National Championship Game]] and its predecessors from 1992 to 2013. It will continue to be awarded to the No. 1 ranked team in the final poll of the season.&lt;ref name="trophy2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=FBS coaches' poll will continue every week despite BCS going away|agency=Associated Press|date=January 13, 2013|accessdate=January 28, 2014|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2014-01-13/fbs-coaches-poll-will-continue-every-week-despite-bcs-going-away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick and Michael Gerrits came up with the idea for a college football trophy to be awarded to the AFCA national champions along with an academic scholarship award to a non-athlete. The intent was to honor the memory of the patriarch of the Gerrits family, Edward J. Gerrits. The trophy consists of a [[Waterford Crystal]] football&lt;ref name="afca-trophy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afca.com/article/article.php?id=Trophy |title=  Trophy|access-date=2011-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126223616/http://www.afca.com/article/article.php?id=Trophy |archive-date=2011-11-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; affixed to an ebony base, and carries a value of over $30,000.  The winning school retains permanent possession of the trophy, as a new one is awarded every year.  The football portion of the trophy weighs approximately eight pounds and together with the stand, it weighs about {{convert|45|lb|kg}} and stands {{convert|34|in|cm}} tall.  It is handmade by master craftspeople at Waterford Crystal and reportedly takes nearly three months to complete.&lt;ref name="afca-trophy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dimensionsguide.com/bcs-trophy-dimensions/&lt;/ref&gt;

The trophy has undergone several sponsorship changes over the years.  It was sponsored by the Gerrits Foundation during the initial 1986 and 1987 seasons and, through the Gerrits' family Pepsi bottling business, [[Pepsi]] became a co-sponsor with the Gerrits Foundation in 1988 and 1989. Due to the poll's affiliation with the [[United Press International]] [[wire service]], it was known as the '''Gerrits Foundation-UPI Coaches Trophy''', the '''UPI Coaches Trophy''' or '''UPI Trophy''' during that time.&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Football Central|publisher=[[United Press International]]|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/10/25/Football-Central/1860530596800/|date=October 25, 1986|accessdate=October 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="upi2"&gt;{{cite web|title=SPORTS NEWS BRIEFS; New Trophy Set For No. 1 Team|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 25, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] was the sole sponsor from 1990 to 1992. [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] began its sponsorship in 1993 and remained until 2001. [[Circuit City (1949–2009 company)|Circuit City]] assumed the sponsorship for the 2002 season. [[ADT Security Services]] was the title sponsor from 2003 to 2005; and from 2009 to 2013, [[Dr Pepper]] sponsored the trophy.&lt;ref name="afca-trophy"/&gt; Since 2014, [[Amway]] has been the trophy sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amway new sponsor of glass football national championship trophy|author=Dennis Dodd|publisher=CBSsports.com|date=February 18, 2014|accessdate=February 19, 2014|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/dennis-dodd/24447594/amway-new-sponsor-of-glass-football-national-championship-trophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official name is the '''American Football Coaches Association National Championship Trophy'''; it was given this permanent name by the association in 2006. In 2009, the AFCA allowed universities to buy replica trophies for any year a school finished first in the Coaches' Poll, from the [[1950 college football season|1950]] to [[1985 NCAA Division I-A football season|1985]] seasons, prior to the trophy's creation in 1986. Around this time the AFCA also began the process of awarding retroactive titles for the [[1922 college football season|1922]] to [[1949 college football season|1949]] seasons. The AFCA asked schools who felt they had a legitimate bid for the title to submit their reasons why so that their committee could hear the case and decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fornelli |first=Tom |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/why-oklahoma-state-has-been-named-college-footballs-1945-national-champion/ |title=Why Oklahoma State has been named college football's 1945 national champion |work=CBS Sports |date=2016-10-13 |access-date=2018-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Oklahoma A&amp;M was awarded the 1945 national championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Culpepper |first=Chuck |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/10/13/oklahoma-state-just-won-the-1945-college-football-national-championship/ |title=Oklahoma State just won the 1945 college football national championship |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2016-10-13 |access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma State was (and continues to be) the only school to apply for the honor for any of the 28 years considered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tramel |first=Berry |url=https://newsok.com/article/5561230/why-is-oklahoma-state-on-an-island-with-the-retroactive-titles/ |title=Why Why is Oklahoma State on an island with the retroactive titles? |publisher=News OK |date=2017-08-23 |access-date=2018-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the AFCA trophy. The AFCA committee stated that [[1945 Army Cadets football team|Army]] could also be recognized as co-champion for 1945 "if the school decides to submit paperwork to the AFCA for evaluation by the committee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=Kendrick |url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/osusportsextra/afca-member-explains-why-osu-awarded-national-championship/article_81901939-ef07-5a8b-a9d1-7599e6f13a37.html |title=AFCA member explains why OSU awarded 1945 national championship |publisher=Tulsa World |date=2016-10-18 |access-date=2018-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[1973 NCAA Division I football season|1973 season]], the final Coaches' Poll was released in early December, after the regular season, but before postseason [[bowl game]]s. Beginning with the [[1974 NCAA Division I football season|1974 season]], the Coaches Poll conducted its final poll after the bowl games.

Throughout the eras of the [[Bowl Championship Series]] and its predecessors (1992–2013) no separate national championship trophy was commissioned by those bodies, with the AFCA Trophy serving that role. During the BCS era the Coaches Trophy was presented to the winning team in an on-field ceremony after the title game.&lt;ref name="usat-trophy"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Playoff era, AFCA will continue to award Coaches Trophy|author=Dan Wolken|publisher=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2014/01/13/afca-coaches-poll-trophy-college-football-playoff/4458075/|date=January 13, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the BCS, its successor playoff system, the [[College Football Playoff]], commissioned a new trophy for its champion; officials wanted a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous championship system.&lt;ref name="SayGoodbyeToTheCrystalFootball"&gt;{{cite web|title=New College Football Playoff will reportedly feature a new trophy|author=Dennis Dodd|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/say-goodbye-to-the-crystal-football-bcs-symbol-will-not-be-retained/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709105549/http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/dennis-dodd/22857775/say-goodbye-to-the-crystal-football-bcs-symbol-will-not-be-retained|archive-date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, coaches were "adamant" that the AFCA trophy continue to be awarded.&lt;ref name="usat-trophy"/&gt; Since the 2014 season, the trophy has been awarded to the team ranked No. 1 in the final Coaches' Poll of the season in a celebration at that team's stadium sometime after the [[College Football Playoff National Championship]].&lt;ref name="trophy2014"/&gt;

The '''Clarkson Cup''' ({{lang-fr|La Coupe Clarkson}}) is a women's [[ice hockey]] trophy, which from 2009 to 2019 was awarded to the winner of the [[Canadian Women's Hockey Championship]] (CWHL champion). With the folding of the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] (CWHL), it was believed this cup would need to find a new use or not be awarded going forward. Like the [[Stanley Cup]] and Canada's [[Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup]], it was named after a former [[Governor General of Canada]]: [[Adrienne Clarkson]].

Though initially awarded in 2006 to the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian national women's hockey team]], it was intended to be awarded to the top women's club in Canada. From 2006 to 2008, it was not awarded, owing to a number of rights issues between Clarkson, [[Hockey Canada]], and the artists responsible for making the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/272389 Clarkson Cup in limbo over ownership rights]. ''Toronto Star'', 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2009, the Clarkson Cup has been awarded, as intended, to the top women's club team. In Canada it is considered to be the cultural equivalent of the men's [[Stanley Cup]] for Canadian women's ice hockey.&lt;ref name=HHOF-ClarksonCup&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhof.com/htmlSilverware/silver_splashclarksoncup.shtml |title= Clarkson Cup |date= 2017 |publisher= Hockey Hall of Fame }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IIHF-2009-03-24&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iihf.com/channels0809/ww/news/news-singleview/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3266&amp;cHash=03a28f833dbdafc5d1152738a8045937 |title=

==History==

===Origins===
When the [[2004–05 NHL season]] was cancelled because of [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]], the [[Stanley Cup]] was not awarded for the first time since the 1918-19 [[Spanish flu]] pandemic.  In February 2005, [[Adrienne Clarkson]] proposed that since the Stanley Cup was to be awarded to the best professional ice hockey team of the year (even though there were Canadian teams in the [[American Hockey League]], which plays for the [[Calder Cup]]), it should be awarded to the best women's hockey team because they were still playing. That idea was brought to [[Susan Fennell]], who was the Commissioner of the [[National Women's Hockey League (1999–2007)|National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL) and also the Mayor of the Canadian city of [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]].  In a media interview, Fennell commented that while the women had great respect for the Stanley Cup, it belonged to men's ice hockey, and that the women actually did have a cup of their own, but simply one with no name. Fennell then came up with the idea that the Governor General should consider lending her name to the women's hockey championship cup, as Lord Stanley had done years before for the men's hockey championship.  Clarkson was thrilled with the idea and later met with Fennell at [[Rideau Hall]], where it was agreed that the women's hockey championship trophy would be named the Clarkson Cup.

Originally, the NWHL Championship Cup was to have a new name placed on it. However, On September 14, 2005, Clarkson announced the creation of a new trophy for women's hockey.

The Clarkson Cup is made of silver and was designed by [[Nunavut Arctic College]] in [[Iqaluit]].  Canadian silversmith Beth M. Biggs was commissioned to make the Clarkson Cup.  She designed and built the sterling trophy and collaborated with three Inuit artists: Okpik Pitseolak, Therese Ukaliannuk, and Pootoogook Qiatsuk. The Inuit artists designed some of the decoration on the trophy.  There are images of the goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]] (one of the most powerful figures in Inuit tradition), Arctic animals, ancient masks, and the flowers of the provinces and territories of Canada.  The actual cup portion of the trophy is not much bigger than a large coffee mug.

===Early problems===
The trophy was awarded to the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian national women's hockey team]] on July 10, 2006, with the expectation that [[Hockey Canada]] would take over the trophy and how it was to be awarded.  However, complications arising due to the rights to the trophy (Clarkson wanting full rights to the trophy from the artists in order to turn the trophy over to Hockey Canada, while the artists wanting Hockey Canada to instead license the Cup in order to collect royalties from its use) and the splintered top level of women's club hockey at the time resulted in the trophy not being awarded for three years.

At the time of the creation of the Clarkson Cup, there were two top professional women's hockey leagues in Canada: the [[National Women's Hockey League (1999)|National Women's Hockey League]] in Eastern Canada and the [[Western Women's Hockey League]] in Western Canada (with one team from [[Minnesota]]) — the latter being formed from two former NWHL teams (the [[Calgary Oval X-Treme]] and [[Edmonton Chimos]]) due to travel costs, with no interleague championships to determine a true national champion.  Though the two leagues were expected to merge in 2007 (with the five-team WWHL being absorbed into the 11-team NWHL as a new "western division"), logistics differences (due to playoff scheduling) made the merger impossible — the WWHL playoffs were finished before the [[Esso Women's Nationals]], while the NWHL playoffs had yet to begin (and would not conclude until after the Nationals and the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|world championships]]).  The NWHL folded at the conclusion of the 2006–07 season, with the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] taking its place.  Though the CWHL and WWHL agreed on a format that would determine a national champion (to be decided with each league sending its two best teams to the Esso Women's Nationals, with the intent that it would be split off as a separate tournament from the senior women's tournament in the future), the Clarkson Cup remained unavailable — the [[Abby Hoffman Cup]] would be awarded in its place until the Clarkson Cup became available.

===2009 to present===
In March 2009, Clarkson and the artists behind the Clarkson Cup settled their licensing dispute, allowing the trophy to be presented.  The inaugural Canadian National Women's Hockey Championship was held later that month, at the [[K-Rock Centre]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], featuring an identical format to that used for the Esso Women's Nationals the previous year for club teams.  The [[Montreal Stars]], champions from the East, prevailed over the [[Minnesota Whitecaps]] in the finals of the championship, which also saw the [[Brampton Thunder|Brampton Canadettes-Thunder]] and the [[Calgary Oval X-Treme]] participate.  Clarkson was on hand to present the trophy to the Stars upon their victory.
